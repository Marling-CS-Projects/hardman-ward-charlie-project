# 2.2.11 Cycle 11: Stopwatch

## Design

In this cycle I will be adding a stopwatch. This stopwatch will appear in the top right corner of the screen and count how many minutes and seconds between the time the countdown finished and the player finishes the race. It serves as a helpful indicator for how long the player has been racing for and how long it takes for them to finish each level.

### Objectives

* [x] Display text for stopwatch in the top right of the screen.
* [x] When the countdown finishes, increase the seconds on the stopwatch by 1 every second.
* [x] When the seconds reaches 60, reset to 0 and increase minutes by 1.

### Usability Features

* User interface -> Text shown in top right for stopwatch.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| stopwatch     | Text to display minutes and seconds elapsed since starting. |
| s             | Update stopwatch every second.                              |
| minutes       | Number of full minutes elapsed since starting.              |
| seconds       | Number of remaining seconds.                                |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```
stopwatch = add_text("00:00", x: width, y: 0, props: {
    minutes: 0,
    seconds: 0
})

receiveEvent("go", func () {
    func updateStopwatch() {
        stopwatch.seconds++
        
        if stopwatch.seconds == 60:
            stopwatch.minutes++
            stopwatch.seconds = 0
            
        secondsFormat = ('0' + stopwatch.seconds).slice(-2)
        minutesFormat = stopwatch.minutes < 10  then: ('0' + stopwatch.minutes).slice(-2)  else: stopwatch.minutes

        stopwatch.setText(minutesFormat + ":" + secondsFormat)
        
        s = setTimeout(updateStopwatch, 1000)
    }
    
    s = setTimeout(updateStopwatch, 1000)
})
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have added a stopwatch to my game to time how long it takes for the players to finish the race. I will further add to it in [Cycle 12](2.2.12-cycle-12.md) so it stops running when the player crosses the finish line.

Firstly, I created a function that returns and displays a stopwatch in the top right of the screen. It has properties for minutes and seconds which are by default set to 0. It displays the time in the format MM:SS, so starts at 00:00.

{% code title="public/misc/stopwatch.js" %}
```javascript
/* Stopwatch function
- Display stopwatch in top right of screen
- Starting at 00:00 (MM:SS)
- Minutes and seconds properties
*/

function Stopwatch() {
    return add([
        text("00:00", { size: 35 }),
        color(200, 200, 200),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("topright"),
        pos(width() - 20, 20),
        z(3),
        {
            minutes: 0,
            seconds: 0
        }
    ])
}
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, I wrote another function that increases the seconds on a given stopwatch by 1 per second and if the seconds exceed 59, they reset back to 0 and minutes are incremented.

{% code title="public/misc/stopwatch.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to start stopwatch
- Take a given stopwatch
- Increase seconds every second
- If seconds overflows, carry over to minutes
*/

function startStopwatch(stopwatch) {
    let s

    function updateStopwatch() {
        stopwatch.seconds++ // Increment seconds

        if (stopwatch.seconds == 60) { // Seconds has reached 60, carry over to minutes
            stopwatch.minutes++ // Increment minutes
            stopwatch.seconds = 0 // Set seconds back to 0
        }

        const secondsFormat = ('0' + stopwatch.seconds).slice(-2) // Put 0 before seconds if necessary
        
        /* It's possible minutes might go into triple-digits 
        (though unlikely) so add 0 before if single digit,
        otherwise leave as is*/
        const minutesFormat = stopwatch.minutes < 10 ? ('0' + stopwatch.minutes).slice(-2) : stopwatch.minutes

        stopwatch.text = `${minutesFormat}:${secondsFormat}` // Set text to formatted minutes and seconds

        s = setTimeout(updateStopwatch, 1000) // Re-run in a second
    }

    s = setTimeout(updateStopwatch, 1000)
}
```
{% endcode %}

Finally in the level scene, the stopwatch is created and when the 'go' event is received, meaning the race has began, it is started.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
const stopwatch = Stopwatch() // Add stopwatch text

window.addEventListener('go', () => {
    startStopwatch(stopwatch) // Start stopwatch
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

I only had one issue in this cycle and it was when adding the stopwatch text to the screen and the text wasn't visible. This was however easily fixable as I had simply forgotten to set the z property of the sprite to be higher than the world layers. After setting it to 3 it displayed correctly.

Test 4: Stopwatch increases by 1 second every second. When seconds reaches 60, they are set back to 0 and minutes are increased by 1.
