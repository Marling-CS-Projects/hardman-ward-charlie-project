# 2.2.7 Cycle 7: Waiting for players screen

## Design

In this cycle, I will be adding another scene to my game. This scene will display the room name and a continually updated list of players connected. It will have a start button which any player in the room can click to start the game. This will work through emitting an event to the server which will in turn emit an event to all clients in the room, who upon receiving the event will change to the level 1 scene. For now this will not have anything and therefore result in an empty screen. However in the next cycles I will add features such as the map and players' cars.

### Objectives

* [x] Create a new scene called "wait"
* [x] When the client joins a room, go to the wait scene.
* [x] Display the room code.
* [x] Display a list of usernames of the members in the room, constantly updated.
* [x] When any player clicks the start button, all players go to empty "level" scene.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| room          | Room the player is in.                 |
| usernames     | List of players in the room.           |
| usernamesList | Text displaying the list of usernames. |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="scenes/wait.js" %}
```
func waitScene(room):
    add_text("Your room code is " + room, 
        size: 25, 
        color: grey,
        pos: centerX, centerY - 200
    )
    
    usernamesList = add_text("",
        size: 20,
        color: grey,
        pos: center
    )
    
    update:
        socket.emit('update usernames')
        
    socket.on('update usernames', usernames => {
        usernamesList = ""
        
        for u in usernames:
            usernamesList.addLine(u)    
    })
    
    startButton = Button(centerX, centerY + 120, "Start")
    
    startButton.click:
        socket.emit('start game')
        
    socket.on('start game', () => {
        go("lvl1")
    })
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="scenes/multiplayer.js" %}
```
func multiplayerScene:
    socket.on('join room', room => {
        go("wait", room)
    })
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="server.js" %}
```
socket.on('update usernames', () => {
    usernames = []
    
    for id in toKeys(rooms[room].members) {
        usernames.addItem(rooms[room].members[id].username)
    }
    
    socket.emit('update usernames', usernames)
})

socket.on('start game', () => {
    io.to(room).emit('start game')
})
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have developed a screen that allows players to see who else has joined the room before starting the game and to start the game for all other players. I will now move onto the gameplay element itself, dedicating the next few cycles to aspects such as world generation and rendering, car mechanics, and countdown to start the race.

Firstly, I modified the response to having successfully joined a room. Instead of printing to the browser console, the game now moves to the "wait" scene. The wait scene takes in one parameter for the room code which will be displayed.

{% code title="public/scenes/multiplayer.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('join room', room => { // Successfully joined room
    go("wait", room) // Go to wait scene
})
```
{% endcode %}

In the "wait" scene, displayed near the top of the screen is the code of the room. It is visible so players can give it to others through whatever means.&#x20;

{% code title="public/scenes/wait.js" %}
```javascript
/* Wait scene
- Display code of room
- Display list of players
- Button to start gameplay
*/

function waitScene(room) {
    // Text displaying room code
    add([
        text("Your room code is " + room, { size: 25 }),
        color(150, 150, 150),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x, center().y - 200)
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, there is the usernames list. This is a list of the usernames of all members in the room. It will be continually updated as frequently as possible so any new players are accounted for as well as any players who leave the room. Every frame, the client requests a new list of usernames from the server. On receiving the list, the usernames list is reset and the usernames are added. This is unnoticeable to the end user.

{% code title="public/scenes/wait.js" %}
```javascript
// Text for list of usernames
const usernamesList = add([
    text("", { size: 20 }),
    color(150, 150, 150),
    area(),
    fixed(),
    anchor("center"),
    pos(center())
])

// Continually request updated list
onUpdate(() => {
    socket.emit('update usernames')
})

/* On receiving list of usernames, reset 
text and add each username on a new line
*/
socket.on('update usernames', us => {
    usernamesList.text = ""

    us.forEach(u => {
        usernamesList.text += u + "\n"
    })
})
```
{% endcode %}

When the server receives the request for a new list of usernames, it goes through each entry in the room's members list and adds the usernames to a new list, and then sends the list of usernames back to the client.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('update usernames', () => { // Client requested updated usernames
    const usernames = []

    // Go through each member and add their username to list
    Object.keys(rooms[room].members).forEach(id => {
            usernames.push(rooms[room].members[id].username)
    })

    socket.emit('update usernames', usernames) // Send new list
})
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, if any player clicks the start button, this will broadcast a message to all members of the same room to start the game. This will prompt everyone's game to change to the level scene, which I will build on in upcoming cycles. For now, it is just empty.

{% code title="public/scenes/wait.js" %}
```javascript
startButton.onClick(() => { // Broadcast to start game when button clicked
    socket.emit('start game')
})

socket.on('start game', () => { // Player requested to start game
    go("level") // Go to level scene
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('start game', () => { // Player requested to start game
    io.to(room).emit('start game') // Broadcast to all players in the room to start
    rooms[room].level = 0 // Set game level, used for determining world
})
```
{% endcode %}
