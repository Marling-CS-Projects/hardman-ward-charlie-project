# 2.2.2 Cycle 2: User account registration

## Design

In this cycle, I will write the code for the user account sign-up form. This will be where players provide their desired username and password to create their account. To ensure a basic level of account security, passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters. I will also make sure when registering that the username given is not taken by another user, and inform the user attempting to register that username if such.

### Objectives

* [x] Design a page for the login and registration forms with HTML and CSS.
* [x] Use POST requests to send information in the form to the server.
* [x] If the given username is already taken by another account, display an error message.
* [x] Hash the password so it cannot be read.
* [x] Write an entry with the username and password to the users table.
* [x] Write HTML for an account registration form with username and password inputs.

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| req.body      | Information submitted in the form, such as username and password.                                                        |
| res           | Send response to client.                                                                                                 |
| db            | Connection to SQLite database.                                                                                           |
| usernameTaken | Results of SQL query for entries in users table with the given username. If this is true, the username is already taken. |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="app.js" %}
```
import bcrypt
import body-parser

app.use(body-parser)

app.post_req('/sign-up', func async (req, res) {
    username = req.body.username
    password = req.body.password
    
    const db = await openDatabase()
    
    usernameTaken = await db.get("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)
    
    if usernameTaken {
        res.errorCode(409).message("Username already in use.")
        halt
    }
    
    hash = bcrypt.hash(password, salts = 10)
    
    await db.run("INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)", [username, hash]")
    await db.close()
    
    res.message("Account creation successful")
})
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have implemented a working registration form to my game, which will allow players to create an account which is a requirement to play the game. Other key features include a validation system, wherein the game checks if the username requested is not already taken; and password hashing through the bcrypt algorithm, adding a layer of security to the accounts system of the game as passwords themselves are not stored in a way readable by humans.

Firstly, I have created new folders in my project's folder: controller and router. The controller contains all the functions that could be executed after receiving an HTTP request, such as a POST request; whereas the router matches each request to the function. In the case of account registration, the router will receive the POST request to register and then refer it onto the relevant function.

{% code title="router/post.js" %}
```javascript
const { Router } = require('express') // Import Router function from Express library
const authController = require('../controller/auth') // Import all functions from auth controller

const router = Router() // Create new Express.js router

// Pass POST requests onto auth controller functions
router.post('/sign-up', authController.signUp)

module.exports = router
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt') // Import bcrypt for hashing passwords

// Import SQLite and SQLite3 libraries
const { Database } = require('sqlite3')
const { open } = require('sqlite')

/* Function to respond to sign up request
- Check if username already taken, display error if so
- Hash password using bcrypt
- Write entry with username and hash to users table
- Go to sign in form
*/

const signUp = async (req, res) => {
    // Account registration
}
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, sign up gets the information sent in the form and queries the users table of the database to check if the username is already taken by another account. In case it is, it will send back to the client a 409 (conflict) error code along with a brief explanation. Additionally, I have moved the openDatabase function created in [Cycle 1](2.2.1-cycle-1.md) to the auth controller file so it is accessible by the sign up and sign in functions that will need it to interact with the database.

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const { username, password } = req.body // Get username and password submitted by user

const db = await openDatabase() // Open accounts database

/* Check if username is not already in use by another account 
- Query entry in users table with given username
- If matching entry is found, send back 409 conflict
*/

const userRow = await db.get("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)

if (userRow) {
    res.status(409).end("Username already in use.")
    return // Stops function executing anymore
}
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, the password is hashed using bcrypt and a new entry containing the username and hash is written to the database. Since the page contains both the sign in and sign up forms, the page is then reloaded so the user can type in their account details to sign in.

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10) // Hash password using bcrypt, 10 rounds of salt

// Write entry with username and hash to users table
await db.run("INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)", [username, hash])
await db.close() // Close database

res.redirect('back') // Reload page
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, the POST router is added to the Express.js application to handle POST requests sent to the server.

{% code title="app.js" %}
```javascript
const { urlencoded } = require('body-parser') // Import middleware to parse request bodies
const postRouter = require('./router/post') // Import POST router

app.use(urlencoded({ extended: true })) // Parse request bodies

app.use("/", postRouter) // Use POST router to handle HTTP requests
```
{% endcode %}
