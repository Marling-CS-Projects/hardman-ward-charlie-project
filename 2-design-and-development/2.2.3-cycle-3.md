# 2.2.3 Cycle 3: User authentication and login

## Design

In this cycle, I will complete the login system by writing the code for handling submissions of the login form. This will compare the password submitted in the login form to the hash stored in the users table of the database and, if they match, generate a UUIDv4 code which will be written to the sessions table and stored as a browser cookie as a way of showing the user is signed in. This is preferrable to simply storing the username in a cookie because cookies can be altered by the client, which could lead to user impersonation if I just store the username. A UUID assigned to a user is much harder to guess.

### Objectives

* [x] Send credentials to the server with a POST request.
* [x] If the username does not exist, display an error.
* [x] If the given password does not match the hash, display the same error.
* [x] Generate a session in format UUIDv4.
* [x] Write an entry with the session and username to the sessions table.
* [x] Save session as browser cookie.

### Usability Features

* Accounts system -> The ability to login to an existing account is added in this cycle. Validation is also used to make sure the username and password match to an account.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| entry         | Result for SQL query for entry with username sent in form.                                           |
| hash          | Hashed password from SQL query for username. Used to check if password submitted by user is correct. |
| session       | UUIDv4 saved in cookie that will be used to identify the user.                                       |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="app.js" %}
```
import uuidv4

app.post('/sign-in', func async (req, res) {
    username, password = req.body
    
    db = await openDatabase()
    
    entry = db.get("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)
    
    if !entry {
        res.errorCode(401).message("Incorrect username or password")
        return
    }
    
    hash = entry.password
    
    password_correct = bcrypt.compare(plaintext=password, hashed=hash)
    
    if !password_correct {
        res.errorCode(401).message("Incorrect username or password")
        return
    }
    
    session = uuidv4()
    
    db.run("INSERT INTO sessions (session, username) VALUES (?, ?)", [session, username])
    db.close()
    
    res.save_cookie('session', session)
    res.message("Login successful")
})

app.post('/sign-up', func async (req, res) {
    // Other code
    
    res.reload()
})
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have implemented a working login form to my game and finished the accounts system of my game so that players can create a new account and sign in to an existing account. This is important so players can be identified by a unique username.

My login system is capable of validating the information submitted in the form to check that the username given exists and that the password entered is correct. This along with the use of the bcrypt algorithm to hash passwords adds a degree of security to sign in.

Firstly, similar to [Cycle 2](2.2.2-cycle-2.md), I have added a function to sign in to the auth controller and linked the POST request to the function in the POST router.&#x20;

{% code title="router/post.js" %}
```javascript
router.post('/sign-in', authController.signIn)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid') // Import function to randomly generate UUIDv4

/* Function to respond to sign in request
- Check if username exists, if not display error
- Compare submitted password with hash to see if they match,
if not, display error
- Generate session using UUIDv4
- Write entry with session and username to sessions table
- Save session in browser cookie
*/

const signIn = async (req, res) => {
    // Account sign in
}
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, similar to [Cycle 2](2.2.2-cycle-2.md), the server queries the SQLite database for an entry matching the username given in the form. However, unlike in Cycle 2 where if an entry was found, it would display an error; in this case, an entry not being found leads to an error. This is because the user is attempting to sign in to an existing account, therefore an entry corresponding to the username is an indication the account does exist.

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const { username, password } = req.body

const db = await openDatabase()

/* Check if username is valid
- Query entry in users table with matching username
- If entry not found, so username doesn't exist, 
return error 401 (unauthorised)
*/

const entry = await db.get("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)

if (!entry) {
    res.status(401).end("Incorrect username or password.")
    return
}
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, the plaintext password submitted in the form is compared to the hashed password in the database. If they match, this means both the username and password entered are valid, and therefore the player can be signed in. However, if the passwords do not match, the same 401 error will be shown in the browser.

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const { password: hash } = entry // Get hashed password from database entry

// Check if passwords match
const passwordCorrect = await bcrypt.compare(password, hash)

if (!passwordCorrect) {
    res.status(401).end("Incorrect username or password.")
    return
}
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, a session is generated using UUIDv4. I deemed it unnecessary to query the sessions table of the database to check if the UUIDv4 already exists as the collision probability for UUIDv4 is so extremely small. After generating the session, it is written to the sessions table of the database alongside the username and saved in a browser cookie so it can be used to authenticate players already signed in.

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const session = uuidv4() // Generate UUIDv4 for session

// Write session and username to sessions table
await db.run("INSERT INTO sessions (session, username) VALUES (?, ?)", [session, username])
await db.close()

res.cookie('session', session) // Save session in cookie
res.redirect('/') // Go to index page (the game)
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

In this cycle I only encountered one error which was in Test 3, where I attempted to get the hashed password to compare to the plaintext password submitted in the form. However, I attempted to get the value of "hash" from the entry, despite the password being stored in the "password" field of the table and there being no field called hash.&#x20;

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const { hash } = entry // Get hashed password from database entry
```
{% endcode %}

This resulted in the server crashing when attempting to sign in and an error:

```
Uncaught Error Error: data and hash arguments required.
```

Since there was no value for "hash" in the entry, when attempting to use bcrypt's compare function to check the two passwords, I was asking to compare the plaintext password with "undefined", which is obviously invalid input because the function expected a hash.

I fixed this by modifying the line so that the server would get the password value of the entry but store it under the hash variable.

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const { password: hash } = entry // Get hashed password from database entry
```
{% endcode %}
