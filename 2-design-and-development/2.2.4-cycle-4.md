# 2.2.4 Cycle 4: Check if player is signed in

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code to check if the player is signed in when they attempt to access the page my game will be on. This will be accomplished by getting the value of the session cookie saved on signing in and submitting it in a new POST request to the server, which will retrieve the corresponding username value from the sessions table of my database. If no username is found, a message exclaiming the user is not signed in will be outputted to the browser console. If a username is found, that will be outputted to the browser console instead.&#x20;

My game will require players be signed in to play, so this check will be used in the next cycle to determine which scene to load when opening the game. If the player is not signed in, they will be shown a message informing them they must be along with a button that takes them to the form. Otherwise, if they are signed in, they will be shown the title screen which allows them to play the game.

### Objectives

* [x] Obtain session from the browser cookie.
* [x] Send a POST request with the session.
* [x] Get username corresponding to the session from the sessions table.
* [x] Output a message to the browser console showing the username.
* [x] If no entry was found, output a message saying the user is not signed in.

### Usability Features

* Accounts system -> Validation is used to check if the player is signed in, which is a requirement to play.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| session       | Unique identifier used to authenticate the browser. |
| username      | Username corresponding to session.                  |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="index.js" %}
```
session = get_cookie('session')

send_post_request('/get-username', session,
    success: res => {
        username = res
        print("You are signed in as " + username)
    }
    error: => {
        print("You are not signed in.")
    }
)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="app.js" %}
```
app.post('/get-username', func (req, res) => {
    db = openDatabase()
    
    session = req.body.session
    
    entry = db.get("SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE session = ?", session)
    
    if (!entry) {
        res.error(404)
        halt
    }
    
    res.end(entry.username)
})
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have developed both a way to get the username of a player using the session stored in their cookie, and a way to check if a player is signed in. This will be useful in [Cycle 5](2.2.5-cycle-5.md), where I develop a title screen, as players who are not signed in will be shown a message telling them to do so. Additionally, in the title screen the username of the player will be shown below the buttons so those sharing a computer will know whose name they are playing under.

Firstly, I have added one last POST request to the POST router I have been working on in [Cycle 2](2.2.2-cycle-2.md) and [3](2.2.3-cycle-3.md). This POST request is sent on loading the index page of the server, and it will contain the value of the session cookie.

{% code title="router/post.js" %}
```javascript
router.post('/get-username', authController.getUsername)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to get username using a session
- Query sessions table for matching entry to session
- If none found, session invalid/user not signed in, return
404 error
- Otherwise, return username from entry
*/

const getUsername = async (req, res) => {
    // get username
}
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, the sessions table is queried for an entry matching the session sent in the request. If an entry where the session matches is not found, the server responds with a 404 not found error code and ends the function early. Unlike previous cycles, no explanation is included as the game will handle it by showing a different screen.

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const { session } = req.body // Get session from request body

const db = await openDatabase()

// Check if session given is valid
const entry = await db.get("SELECT username FROM sessions WHERE session = ?", session)
await db.close()
    
if (!entry) { // No entry matching session found.
    res.status(404).end() // 404 error
    return
}
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, in the case an entry was found, the value of the username is sent in the response to the client.&#x20;

{% code title="controller/auth.js" %}
```javascript
const { username } = entry

res.end(username) // Send username back to client
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, the browser sends a POST request 'get-username' to the server using the JQuery library. If the request is successful and a username was obtained, the response is stored as username and a message is printed to the browser console saying the username. Otherwise, if the request resulted in an error, a message is printed to the browser console saying you are not signed in. These messages are only temporary and in [Cycle 5](2.2.5-cycle-5.md) when I add the title screen I will change them to go to different scenes.

{% code title="public/index.html" %}
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/index.js" %}
```javascript
let username

let session = document.cookie.split("=")[1] // Get value of session cookie

/* Send get-username POST request
- Include session value
- If successful, print message with username
- If error, print message saying you are not signed in
*/

$.post({
    url: "/get-username",
    data: {
        session: session
    },
    success: res => {
        username = res

        console.log("You are signed in as " + username)
    },
    error: () => {
        console.log("You are not signed in.")
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}
