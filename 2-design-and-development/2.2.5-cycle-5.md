# 2.2.5 Cycle 5: Title screen

## Design

In this cycle I will be writing the first scene of my game: the title screen. This will appear to signed in users and will have the title of the game in large text alongside play and sign out buttons in the centre and text telling the player what their username is.

In addition, I will write another scene which shows if the user is found to be signed out through the check I implemented in [Cycle 4](2.2.4-cycle-4.md). This scene will also have title text but instead of play and sign out buttons it will have text informing the player they need to sign in to play, along with a sign in button that takes them to the sign in form created in [Cycle 2](2.2.2-cycle-2.md) and [3](2.2.3-cycle-3.md).

### Objectives

* [x] Initialise the Kaboom.js engine.
* [x] Create a new scene "title".
* [x] Display game title in large text at the top of the screen.
* [x] Add buttons to play and sign out.
* [x] Create a new scene "login info"
* [x] Display message telling the player they must sign in to play.
* [x] Add button to sign in, when clicked this goes to the login page.

### Usability Features

* User interface -> Title screen and login info screen.
* Accounts system -> Validation from [Cycle 4](2.2.4-cycle-4.md) used to check if player is signed in and show them the correct screen.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                   |

| center        | Co-ordinates for centre of screen.    |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="index.js" %}
```
kaboom()

scene("title", titleScene)
scene("login info", loginInfoScene)

sendPostRequest('/get-username', session, 
    success: res => {
        username = res
        
        go "title"
    }
    error: => {
        go "login info"
    }
)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="scenes/title.js" %}
```
func titleScene():
    text "PIXEL_RACER", size 96, pos centerX, 10
    
    playButton = Button(centerX, centerY - 40, "Play")
    signOutButton = Button(centerX, centerY + 40, "Sign Out")
    
    text "Signed in as " + username, size 22, pos centerX, centerY + 100
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="scenes/login-info.js" %}
```
func loginInfoScene:
    text "PIXEL RACER", size 96, pos centerX, 10
    
    text "In order to play, you must sign in", size 20, pos centerX, centerY - 60
    
    signInButton = Button(centerX, centerY, "Sign In")
    
    signInButton.clicked:
        goToPage "login.html"
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="sprites/button.js" %}
```
func Button(x, y, label):
    button = rectangle 200x60, colour grey, pos x, y
    
    text label, size 25, colour white, pos x, y
    
    return button
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have written the code for the title screen. This will allow players to play, sign out, and view their username. Additionally, I have added another screen that is displayed to players who aren't signed in telling them that they must be to play and including a button that takes them to the sign in page.

Firstly, Kaboom.js is initialised with a background of light blue. This draws a canvas that by default takes up the entirety of the page.

{% code title="public/index.js" %}
```javascript
kaboom({
    background: [135, 206, 235] // RGB for light blue
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/index.html" %}
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/kaboom@3000.0.1/dist/kaboom.js"></script>
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, two new scenes are declared: title and login info. The former will allow the player to select to play, sign out, and see their username; while the latter will merely inform them they must sign in and provide a button taking them to that page.

{% code title="public/index.js" %}
```javascript
// Define all scenes
scene("title", titleScene)
scene("login info", loginInfoScene)
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, the get-username JQuery POST request is modified so that instead of printing to the console, the game goes to the title or login info scenes depending on the response. A successful response with the username goes to the title scene, while an error goes to the login info scene.

{% code title="public/index.js" %}
```javascript
success: res => { // Username found
    username = res
        
    go("title") // Go to title scene
},
error: () => { // Error while getting username
    go("login info") // Go to login info scene
}
```
{% endcode %}

Fourthly, to avoid repeatedly having to specify rectangle dimensions, colour, and text, I created a function that draws a button at the specified position with a given label. It is stored under the sprites folder in the public directory. The function returns a grey rectangle in the given X and Y and adds white text with the label on top of it.&#x20;

{% code title="public/sprites/button.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to draw a button with label
- Draw grey rectangle 200x60 at specified co-ordinates
- Add white text with label on top of it
*/

function Button(x, y, label) {
    const button = add([
        rect(200, 60),
        color(170, 170, 170),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(x, y)
    ])

    add([
        text(label, { size: 25 }),
        color(255, 255, 255),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(x, y)
    ])

    return button
}
```
{% endcode %}

Fifthly, I created the functions for the title and login info scenes. These will be executed on loading these scenes. Both of them have large text "PIXEL RACER" as the title at the top middle of the screen.

{% code title="public/scenes/title.js" %}
```javascript
/* Title scene
- This will be shown to signed in users
- Game title
- Play and Sign Out buttons
- Username displayed below buttons
*/

function titleScene() {
    add([
        text("PIXEL RACER", { size: 96 }),
        color(160, 160, 160), // Grey
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("top"),
        pos(center().x, 10) // Top middle of screen
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/logininfo.js" %}
```javascript
/* Login info scene
- This will be shown to signed out users
- Game title
- Message saying account is required
- Button that goes to login page
*/

function loginInfoScene() {
    add([
        text("PIXELRACER", { size: 96 }),
        color(160, 160, 160),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("top"),
        pos(center().x, 10)
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

Sixthly, on the title scene I added two buttons for play and sign out. These are at the centre of the screen slightly spaced apart. Below the buttons I added text stating the player's username.

{% code title="public/scenes/title.js" %}
```javascript
// Add buttons for play and sign out to the centre of the screen
const playButton = Button(center().x, center().y - 40, "Play")
const signOutButton = Button(center().x, center().y + 40, "Sign Out")

// Add text showing username below buttons
add([
    text("Signed in as: " + username, { size: 22 }),
    color(150, 150, 150),
    area(),
    fixed(),
    anchor("center"),
    pos(center().x, center().y + 100) // 100px below centre
])
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, I added some informative text saying you must sign in to play the game to the login info scene. Below that I added a button to sign in and configured it to go to the login page if clicked.

{% code title="public/scenes/logininfo.js" %}
```javascript
// Add text informing player they must sign in
add([
    text("In order to play Pixel Racer, you must sign in.", { size: 20 }),
    color(150, 150, 150),
    area(),
    fixed(),
    anchor("center"),
    pos(center().x, center().y - 60) // 60px above centre
])

const signInButton = Button(center().x, center().y, "Sign In") // Add sign in button to centre

// When sign in button is clicked, go to sign in form
signInButton.onClick(() => {
    location.href = "/sign-in.html"
})
```
{% endcode %}
