# 2.2.21 Cycle 21: Level leaderboard

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code for the leaderboard that shows after all players have completed a race. It will display each player's position in that race, how many points they gained, and their overall standing position. After ten seconds, any player can click a button to move onto the next level.

### Objectives

* [x] Leaderboard displays after each level showing players ordered by when they finished.
* [x] After five seconds game goes onto the next level.
* [x] Player gets points based on how they did.

### Usability Features

* User interface -> Leaderboard.
* Levels -> Transition between levels.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| leaderboards  | List of leaderboards for each level.      |
| level         | Level the room is currently on.           |
| leaderboard   | Leaderboard obtained from server by game. |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="public/scenes/leaderboard.js" %}
```
func leaderboardScene():
    text "LEADERBOARD", size 72, pos centerX, 10
    
    positionText = text "Position\n", size 20, pos centerX - 150, centerY
    usernameText = text "Username\n", size 20, pos center
    pointsText = text "New Points\n", size 20, pos centerX + 150, centerY
    
    on('get leaderboard', func (leaderboard):
        rectangle 450, leaderboard.len + 1 * 22, colour darkgrey, pos centerX, centerY - 10
        
        for i in range(0, leaderboard.len):
            positionText += (i + 1) + "\n"
            usernameText += leaderboard[i].username + "\n"
            pointsText += leaderboard[i].points + "\n"
            
    on('next level, func ():
        go "level"
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="server.js" %}
```
on('finish', func(position):
    if not rooms[room].leaderboards[level]:
        rooms[room].leaderboards[level] = []
        
    points = [10, 5, 4, 2, 0]
    
    rooms[room].leaderboards[level].push({
        username username,
        points points[position]
    })
    
    totalPlayers = rooms[room].members.keys.len
    finishedPlayers = rooms[room].leaderboards[level].keys.length
    
    if totalPlayers == finishedPlayers:
        to(room).emitAll('go to leaderboard')
        
on('get leaderboard', func():
    emit('get leaderboard', rooms[room].leaderboards[level])
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

After finishing this cycle, I have added leaderboards shown at the end of each level which display how players performed ranked by how soon they finished. Additionally, I have implemented a transition between levels which takes place after five seconds of the leaderboard being shown, which I view as a reasonable amount of time for the player to see their progress.

Firstly, in [Cycle 12](2.2.12-cycle-12.md) to end the stopwatch after finishing, I had to dispatch a custom JavaScript event that could be handled from a point in the code where the timeout was accessible. To detect when the player crosses the finish line, I have added another listener for this event this time in the level scene. When this listener is triggered, the game gets the player's position from the position indicator and sends a Socket.IO event to the server saying they have finished along with their position.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
let finished = false

window.addEventListener('finish', () => {
    if (!finished) {
        socket.emit('finish', parseInt(positionIndicator.text) - 1)

        finished = true
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

When the server receives this event, it creates a leaderboard array for that level if it doesn't already exist. It then uses the position to determine how many points the player got for that level, with 1st place getting 10 points, 2nd place getting 5, and so on. The username of the player and new points is pushed to the leaderboard for that level.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('finish', position => {
    if (!rooms[room].leaderboards[level]) {
        rooms[room].leaderboards[level] = []
    }

    const points = [10, 5, 4, 2, 0]

    rooms[room].leaderboards[level].push({
        username: username,
        points: points[position]
    })
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, once all players have finished, the game should then progress onto the leaderboard. Whenever a player finishes, the server compares the number of members of the room to the number of players who have finished. If they are the same, an event is broadcasted to all clients telling them to go to the leaderboard.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
const totalPlayers = Object.keys(rooms[room].members).length
const finishedPlayers = Object.keys(rooms[room].leaderboards[level]).length

if (totalPlayers == finishedPlayers) {
    io.to(room).emit('go to leaderboard')
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('go to leaderboard', () => {
    go("leaderboard")
})
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, I have created a new scene for the level leaderboard. It has the text "Leaderboard" in large at the top of the screen. Three text sprites are added for position, username, and new points; these will serve as columns for the data of the leaderboard.

{% code title="public/scenes/leaderboard.js" %}
```javascript
function leaderboardScene() { 
    socket.off()

    add([
        text("Leaderboard", { size: 72 }),
        color(160, 160, 160),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("top"),
        pos(center().x, 10)
    ])

    const positionText = add([
        text("Position\n", { size: 20 }),
        color(255, 255, 255),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        z(2),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x - 150, center().y)
    ])

    const usernameText = add([
        text("Username\n", { size: 20 }),
        color(255, 255, 255),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        z(2),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center())
    ])

    const pointsText = add([
        text("New Points\n", { size: 20 }),
        color(255, 255, 255),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        z(2),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x + 150, center().y)
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

Fourthly, the game requests the leaderboard from the server. The server on receiving this event sends back the leaderboard array for the level.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('get leaderboard', () => {
    socket.emit('get leaderboard', rooms[room].leaderboards[level])
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/leaderboard.js" %}
```javascript
socket.emit('get leaderboard')
```
{% endcode %}

After sending the leaderboard, the server waits five seconds and then checks what level the player is on. If they are on level 4 (3 as level 1 is 0) the server sends an event to the client telling them to go to the final leaderboard. For now this does nothing as I have not implemented the final leaderboard yet. Otherwise, the level is incremented and the server tells the client to go onto the next level. Five seconds in my opinion gives the players enough time to see their performance for that level.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    if (level == 3) {
        socket.emit('go to final leaderboard')
    } else {
        level++
        socket.emit('next level')
    }
}, 5000)
```
{% endcode %}

Fifthly, when the game receives the leaderboard from the server, a grey rectangle is drawn with width 450 and height based on how many entries there are, in the centre of the screen. This will act as a background for the leaderboard. The entries themselves are then displayed in their text columns.

{% code title="public/scenes/leaderboard.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('get leaderboard', leaderboard => {
    add([
        rect(450, (leaderboard.length + 1) * 22),
        color(100, 100, 100),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        z(1),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x, center().y - 10)
    ])

    for (let i = 0; i < leaderboard.length; i++) {
        positionText.text += (i + 1) + "\n"
        usernameText.text += leaderboard[i].username + "\n"
        pointsText.text += leaderboard[i].points += "\n"
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, if the game receives a 'next level' event it goes to the level scene. The level number is stored on the server so the client does not need to do anything else.

{% code title="public/scenes/leaderboard.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('next level', () => {
    go("level")
})
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

The only challenge I encountered in this cycle was in test 1 and was caused by the Socket.IO listeners such as for car movement updates still running even after Kaboom.js changed scene. This meant if they were triggered, the functions would still run even in the leaderboard scene. This resulted in an error as these functions often attempt to modify variables and objects such as sprites that do not exist in the leaderboard scene, resulting in a TypeError.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In my case, it seemed to be updating the position and angle of cars that resulted in a TypeError as shown by the mention of the "angle" property and examining the code afterwards.

This was fixed by removing all previous Socket.IO listeners at the start of the leaderboard scene. This means events from the level scene would no longer be handled should the game receive them, until it goes back to the level scene.

{% code title="" %}
```javascript
function leaderboardScene() {
    socket.off() // Remove previous Socket.IO listeners
```
{% endcode %}
