# 2.2.21 Cycle 21: Level leaderboard

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code for the leaderboard that shows after all players have completed a race. It will display each player's position in that race, how many points they gained, and their overall standing position. After ten seconds, any player can click a button to move onto the next level.

### Objectives

* [x] Leaderboard displays after each level showing players ordered by when they finished.
* [x] After five seconds game goes onto the next level.
* [x] Player gets points based on how they did.
