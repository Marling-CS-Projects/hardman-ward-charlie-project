# 2.2.19 Cycle 19: Monster Army and behaviour

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code for the Monster Army power-up.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [ ] Monster Army power-up spawns 3-5 random types of monster.
* [x] Zombies chase after players and hit them, inflicting 1 point of damage.
* [ ] Skeletons shoot arrows at the players, inflicting 2 points per hit.
* [ ] Creepers explode when a player is close, inflicting 4 points.
* [ ] Monsters do not pursue the player that spawned them.
* [x] Monsters disappear after 30 seconds of being spawned.
