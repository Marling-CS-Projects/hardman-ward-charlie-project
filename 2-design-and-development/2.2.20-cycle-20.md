# 2.2.20 Cycle 20: Monster Army and behaviour

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code for the Monster Army power-up. When activated, it will spawn five monsters: two zombies, two skeletons, and a creeper. The zombies will chase after other players and hit them when close. The skeletons will get close to other players but not right up to them and then shoot arrows in their direction. The creeper will run towards other players and explode.&#x20;

All of these monsters deal varying amounts of damage. The purpose of this power-up is not for the player to fight the monsters but to try to avoid them. The monsters are intended as an inconvenience and distraction for other players. After 30 seconds, they disappear.

### Objectives

* [x] Monster Army power-up spawns 3-5 random types of monster.
* [x] Zombies chase after players and hit them, inflicting 1 point of damage.
* [x] Skeletons shoot arrows at the players, inflicting 2 points per hit.
* [x] Creepers explode when a player is close, inflicting 4 points.
* [x] Monsters do not pursue the player that spawned them.
* [x] Monsters disappear after 30 seconds of being spawned.

### Usability Features

* Mechanics -> Monsters.
* Mechanics -> The game detects collision between the player, monsters, and arrows.
* Mechanics -> Power-ups.
* Effective -> Combat power-ups to distract other players.
* Engaging -> Intelligent monsters add a level of difficulty to the game.

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have implemented the monster army power-up which is useful for purposes of distracting and inflicting damage upon other players. The power-up spawns five monsters: two zombies, two skeletons, and a creeper. These monsters will pursue nearby players other than the one that activated the power-up, and attack them, inflicting damage.&#x20;

Firstly, I created a new function for spawning a monster. This takes in arguments for the X and Y co-ordinate of the monster, the type of monster, and the index of the player it is allegient to, and therefore won't attack.

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to spawn a monster
- Summon monster at given X and Y.
- Give the monster the textue of the type of monster.
- Take the index of the player it is allegient to
(won't attack).
- Assign the monster a number which will be used to
distinguish from others when sending and receiving
updates.
- Three types of monster: zombie, skeleton, and creeper.
*/

function Monster(x, y, type, allegience) {
    const monsters = get("monster")

    const monster = add([
        sprite(type),
        area(),
        body(),
        pos(x, y),
        anchor("center"),
        z(3),
        {
            number: (monsters.length) ? monsters[monsters.length-1].number + 1 : 0,
            angle: 0,
            dead: false,
            allegience: allegience
        },
        "monster",
        type
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

The function creates a new sprite of the specified type of monster and places it at the given co-ordinates. It assigns it four properties. The "number" is either 0 or the number of the latest spawned monster add 1. The angle will allow it to be rotated which is important as the game will need the angle to determine how to get to the closest other player.&#x20;

After thirty seconds, the monster sprite will be destroyed and the "dead" property set to true. This property is important so the AI of the monster will know when it should stop looking for players as the monster no longer exists.

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
// Monster disappears after 30 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
    destroy(monster)
    monster.dead = true
}, 30000)
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, when the player activates the monster army power-up, the game will run the Monster function five times, with different values for X so the monsters are spread apart and for type. The first two will be zombies, the second two skeletons, and the last a creeper.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
case "monster-army":
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // Spawn five monsters
        // First two monsters are zombies, second two skeletons, final creeper
        const monsterType = (i < 2) ? "zombie" : (i == 4) ? "creeper" : "skeleton"

        const x = 800 + (i * 100)  // Monsters spread apart horizontally in the road
        const y = myCar.pos.y + 300 // 300 blocks down from player

        const monster = Monster(x, y, monsterType, index) // Summon monster
```
{% endcode %}

This code however only summons monsters for the player who activated it. To summon monsters for all players in the room, the game must then broadcast an event containing information about the monster to all players in the room, who then receive it and summon a monster with those properties.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.emit('spawn monster', { // Broadcast monster to room
    position: monster.pos,
    number: monster.number,
    type: monsterType
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('spawn monster', data => { // Player has spawned a monster
    socket.to(room).emit('spawn monster', data) // Tell others in the room to spawn the monster with the same properties
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('spawn monster', data => { // Another player has spawned a monster
    const { position, number, type } = data
    const monster = Monster(position.x, position.y, type)
    monster.number = number
})
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, an AI will be activated for the monster based on what type it is. This affects how the AI behaves and attacks other players.

```javascript
switch (monsterType) { // Activate AI depending on monster type
    case "zombie": // Monster is zombie
        zombieAI(monster) // Activate zombie AI
        break

    case "skeleton":
        skeletonAI(monster)
        break

    case "creeper":
        creeperAI(monster)
        break
```

If the monster being spawned is a zombie, the zombie AI will be activated on the monster. This means the monster will walk slowly towards other players nearby and hit them, inflicting one point of damage each time. First, the zombie will search for players within 12 blocks (1200 pixels) distance of it, and then determine which one is closest.

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
let nearestCarIndex = null
let nearestCarDistance = null

/* Determine nearest car
- Cars within a 12 block (1200 pixel) radius of the 
monster.
- Do not pursue the car that summoned the monster.
- Compare each car's distance to see who is closest.
*/
get("car").forEach(car => {
    // Get difference in X and Y co-ordinates between car and monster
    const diffInX = car.pos.x - monster.pos.x 
    const diffInY = car.pos.y - monster.pos.y
    
    const distance = Math.sqrt(diffInX ** 2 + diffInY ** 2) // Use Pythagoras to calculate real distance
    
    // If car is within 12 blocks, not dead, and did not summon the monster
    if (distance < 1200 && !car.dead && monster.allegience != car.index) {
        // If distance is lower than other car's or no car meeting that criteria previously found
        if (distance < nearestCarDistance || nearestCarDistance == null) {
            // Car is now the nearest car and target of monster
            nearestCarIndex = car.index
            nearestCarDistance = distance
        }
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

This code calculates the distance between each car and the zombie. If the distance is less than 1200, the player is not dead, and the player did not summon the monster, the AI will then proceed to check if the player is closest to the zombie than any previous players detected to be in the 12 block radius, or alternatively if no player has yet been found to be in that radius. If this is the case, it will set the nearest car index and distance variables to the index of the car and the distance between the car and the zombie respectively.

Next, if a player has been detected to be sufficiently close to the zombie, the game will calculate the angle the zombie must start moving at to get to the player and then use sin and cos functions to calculate the change in X and Y for each frame.&#x20;

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
if (nearestCarIndex !== null) { // A car within range has been found
    const car = get("car")[nearestCarIndex]
    const diffInX = car.pos.x - monster.pos.x
    const diffInY = car.pos.y - monster.pos.y
    
    monster.angle = toDegrees(Math.atan2(diffInY, diffInX)) + 90 // Calculate angle to move at
    
    // Calculate change in X and Y and move
    monster.pos.x += Math.sin(toRadians(monster.angle)) * 5
    monster.pos.y -= Math.cos(toRadians(monster.angle)) * 5
```
{% endcode %}

As the AI will only be activated for the player that summoned the zombie, and for all other players it will just be an update from that player's client, the game will then broadcast an event to all other players in the room with the updated position and angle of the monster, as well as the number so their games know which monster to modify.

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
socket.emit('update monster', {
    position: monster.pos,
    angle: monster.angle,
    number: monster.number
})
```
{% endcode %}

Similar to the zombie AI, the skeleton AI also continually checks for the closest player. However, it will only walk towards the player until it is 5 blocks apart, since it attacks by shooting with arrows rather than hitting them.&#x20;

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
if (nearestCarDistance > 500) { // Car further away than 5 blocks
    // Go towards car
    monster.pos.x += Math.sin(toRadians(monster.angle)) * 5
    monster.pos.y -= Math.cos(toRadians(monster.angle)) * 5
} 
```
{% endcode %}

Otherwise, if the skeleton is in 5 blocks range, it will shoot an arrow. A timeout has been set for arrows so each skeleton can only shoot one per second, because the game would become unplayable otherwise as so many arrows would be firing at once which would almost instantly kill the player being attacked, and also because of the lag it would cause. An event is broadcasted to all other clients in the room to spawn an arrow at the same position and angle.

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
else { // Skeleton within 5 blocks of car
    if (!monster.timeout) { // Not on 1 second timeout
        const arrow = Arrow(monster.pos.x, monster.pos.y, monster.angle) // Shoot arrow

        socket.emit('shoot arrow', {
            position: arrow.pos,
            angle: arrow.angle
        })

        monster.timeout = true // Put skeleton on timeout, no shooting for 1 second

        setTimeout(() => {
            monster.timeout = false
        }, 1000) // Lift timeout after 1 second
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('shoot arrow', data => {
    const { position, angle } = data

    Arrow(position.x, position.y, angle)
})
```
{% endcode %}

The arrow function works very similarly to the algorithm for moving a monster towards a player, however the angle it is to move at is passed into the function rather than being worked out based on the closest player as I want the arrow to move towards the skeleton's target rather than determine its own target that potentially might not be that of the skeleton.

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to shoot arrow
- Place arrow at given X and Y and at angle.
- Continually move until it has moved 2000
pixels, the ndestroy.
- Destroy if hits car.
*/

function Arrow(x, y, angle) {
    const arrows = get("arrows")

    const arrow = add([
        sprite("arrow"),
        area(),
        body(),
        pos(x, y),
        anchor("center"),
        z(3),
        {
            number: (arrows.length) ? arrows[arrows.length-1].number + 1 : 0,
            angle: angle,
            dead: false,
            distance: 0,
            maxDistance: 2000
        },
        "arrow"
    ])

    onUpdate(() => {
        if (!arrow.dead) {
            if (arrow.distance < arrow.maxDistance) {
                arrow.pos.x += Math.sin(toRadians(arrow.angle)) * 6
                arrow.pos.y -= Math.cos(toRadians(arrow.angle)) * 6
                
                arrow.distance += 6
            } else { // Arrow has exceeded maximum distance
                destroy(arrow)
                arrow.dead = true
            }
        }
    })

    arrow.onCollide("car", () => { // Arrow hits car
        destroy(arrow) // Destroy arrow
        arrow.dead = true
    })
    
    return arrow
}
```
{% endcode %}

Unlike the monsters, the arrow is destroyed after travelling 2,000 pixels. It is safe to assume after this the arrow will likely be out of camera view and unlikely to hit anyone.&#x20;

The creeper AI is almost identical to the zombie's, except it is faster and when it collides with a car that is not the player who spawned it, it explodes after a second. It broadcasts an event to the room telling all other games to explode that creeper too.

{% code title="public/sprites/monster.js" %}
```javascript
monster.onCollide("car", car => { // Creeper hits car
    if (car.index != monster.allegience) { // Car did not summon creeper
        setTimeout(() => {
            socket.emit('explode creeper', monster.number)
            creeperExplode(monster)
        }, 1000) // Explode after one second
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('explode creeper', number => { // Another player's creeper exploded
    const monsters = get("monster")
    const monsterIndex = monsters.findIndex(monster => monster.number === number)

    const creeper = monsters[monsterIndex]

    if (creeper) {
        creeperExplode(creeper)
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, I added handlers to the handleCollisions function for the player's car sprite for when the player is hit by a zombie or a skeleton's arrow. There is no need to add a separate entry for the creeper as handling collisions with explosions is already there.&#x20;

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
function handleCollisons(car) {
    // previous collisions
    
    car.onCollideUpdate("zombie", zombie => { // Zombie hit player
        if (!zombie.timeout && zombie.allegience != car.index) { // Zombie not on timeout and the zombie wasn't summoned by the player
            takeDamage(car) // Take 1 point of damage
    
            // Put zombie on timeout for two seconds, no more damage in that time
            zombie.timeout = true
    
            setTimeout(() => {
                zombie.timeout = false
            }, 2000)
        }
    
    })
    
    car.onCollide("arrow", () => { // Arrow hit player
        takeDamage(car, 2) // Take 2 points of damage
    })
}
```
{% endcode %}

In the case of the zombie, I use onCollideUpdate as onCollide is only triggered when the sprites start to collide not as they continue to collide. This could mean a zombie is continually colliding with the player but the player only took one point of damage as handling the collision only happened once. Instead, I implemented a timeout so the zombie can only inflict damage on the player once every two seconds when they are constantly colliding.

### Challenges

In this cycle I faced one issue, in test 5 after I had set monsters to disappear after 30 seconds, arrows kept shooting even after the skeletons had disappeared. This is because Kaboom.js' onUpdate function is not specific to the sprite and so kept running after it had been destroyed, meaning arrows would still be shot at other players who went to where the skeletons were.

To fix this, I added a property "dead" to monsters which starts off as false and is set to true after 30 seconds along with the sprite being destroyed. When onUpdate is executed in the monster's AI, the property of dead is checked to be false before running the code.

{% code title="" %}
```javascript
function skeletonAI(monster) {
    onUpdate(() => {
        if (!monster.dead) {
            // execute code
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
