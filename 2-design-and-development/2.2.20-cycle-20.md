# 2.2.20 Cycle 20: Monster Army and behaviour

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code for the Monster Army power-up. When activated, it will spawn five monsters: two zombies, two skeletons, and a creeper. The zombies will chase after other players and hit them when close. The skeletons will get close to other players but not right up to them and then shoot arrows in their direction. The creeper will run towards other players and explode.&#x20;

All of these monsters deal varying amounts of damage. The purpose of this power-up is not for the player to fight the monsters but to try to avoid them. The monsters are intended as an inconvenience and distraction for other players. After 30 seconds, they disappear.

### Objectives

* [x] Monster Army power-up spawns 3-5 random types of monster.
* [x] Zombies chase after players and hit them, inflicting 1 point of damage.
* [x] Skeletons shoot arrows at the players, inflicting 2 points per hit.
* [x] Creepers explode when a player is close, inflicting 4 points.
* [x] Monsters do not pursue the player that spawned them.
* [x] Monsters disappear after 30 seconds of being spawned.
