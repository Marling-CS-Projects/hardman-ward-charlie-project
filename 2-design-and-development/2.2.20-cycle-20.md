# 2.2.20 Cycle 20: Level leaderboard

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code for the leaderboard that shows after all players have completed a race. It will display each player's position in that race, how many points they gained, and their overall standing position. After ten seconds, any player can click a button to move onto the next level.
