# 2.2.17 Cycle 17: TNT

## Design

In this cycle I will be writing the code for the TNT power-up. The purpose for this is to allow a player to secure their lead over players behind them. When the player activates the power-up, a block of TNT will be placed a few blocks behind the player and either explode in five seconds or explode when it hits another player.&#x20;

The TNT explosion will be larger than the fireball explosion in [Cycle 16](2.2.16-cycle-16.md) and deal 8 points of damage. This means it is very important for players to avoid the TNT or subsequent explosions.

### Objectives

* [x] Throw TNT behind the player activating it.
* [x] If a player comes close to the TNT, explode it.
* [x] Explode TNT after three seconds if it hasn't already.
* [x] Any players caught in the explosion lose 8 health points.

### Usability Features

* Mechanics -> TNT power-up used to attack other players.
* Mechanics -> The game continually checks if the TNT hits a player.
* Mechanics -> When the TNT is activated, an event is broadcasted to all players in the room.
* Effective -> TNT can inflict heavy damage on other players and even kill them if they aren't at full health which distracts them for a short period.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name    | Use                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| TNT(x, y, angle) | Function to throw TNT behind co-ordinates at an angle. |
| distance         | Distance travelled when the TNT is thrown.             |
| maxDistance      | Maximum distance the TNT travels before stopping.      |

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have implemented the TNT power-up into the game which will be primarily used by the player for inflicting a large amount of damage on players close behind. The TNT will either explode when it hits another player or after three seconds since being thrown, inflicting 8 points of damage on anyone caught in the collision.

Firstly, I created a function to throw the TNT. It takes in the X and Y position to spawn at and the angle the TNT should be rotated at which depends on the angle of the player's car that threw it.&#x20;

{% code title="sprites/tnt.js" %}
```javascript
function TNT(x, y, angle) {
    const tnt = add([
        sprite("tnt"),
        area(),
        pos(x, y),
        z(2),
        anchor("center"),
        "tnt",
        { 
            angle: angle,
            distance: 0,
            maxDistance: 400,
            speed: {
                x: Math.sin(toRadians(angle)) * 20,
                y: Math.cos(toRadians(angle)) * 20
            }
        }
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

The TNT will then move until it has reached 400 pixels from spawn point. This will look like it's been thrown from the back of the car.

{% code title="sprites/tnt.js" %}
```javascript
onUpdate(() => {
    if (tnt.distance < tnt.maxDistance) {
        tnt.pos.x -= tnt.speed.x
        tnt.pos.y += tnt.speed.y

        tnt.distance += 20
    }
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, once the TNT has stopped moving, it will continually check for cars that come into a 150 pixel range of it (1 and a half blocks). If a car comes into this range, the TNT will explode.&#x20;

{% code title="sprites/tnt.js" %}
```javascript
get("car").forEach(car => {
    const distance = Math.sqrt((tnt.pos.x - car.pos.x) ** 2 + (tnt.pos.y - car.pos.y) ** 2)
    
    if (distance < 150) {
        explode(tnt)
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, the TNT will explode if not already done so after 3 seconds.

{% code title="sprites/tnt.js" %}
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    explode(tnt)
}, 3000)
```
{% endcode %}

Fourthly, when shift is pressed to activate power-up, if the player has TNT, the game will send an event to all other clients with the X and Y co-ordinates of the TNT and the angle all of which are the same as the player's car.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
case "tnt":
    socket.emit('place tnt', {
        x: myCar.pos.x,
        y: myCar.pos.y,
        angle: myCar.angle
    })
    break
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, when an event to place TNT is received, the TNT function created earlier is executed passing in the values for X, Y, and angle as parameters. This throws TNT behind the player that activated the power-up which should explode when a player comes close or after three seconds.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('place tnt', position => {
    TNT(position.x, position.y, position.angle)
})
```
{% endcode %}
