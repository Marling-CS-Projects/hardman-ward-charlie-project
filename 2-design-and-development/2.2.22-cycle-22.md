# 2.2.22 Cycle 22: Final leaderboard

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the scene for the final leaderboard that displays after the players in the room have completed all four levels. This leaderboard will determine the rankings based on points accumulated across every level with the most points coming first and the least points coming last.

It will also include a button that when clicked takes the player back to the title screen allowing them to play the game again.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Show final leaderboard after all players in the room finish level 4.
* [x] Order players based on their points accumulated across all races.
* [x] Add button that goes back to title screen.
