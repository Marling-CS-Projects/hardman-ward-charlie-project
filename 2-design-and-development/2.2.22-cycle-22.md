# 2.2.22 Cycle 22: Final leaderboard

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the scene for the final leaderboard that displays after the players in the room have completed all four levels. This leaderboard will determine the rankings based on points accumulated across every level with the most points coming first and the least points coming last.

It will also include a button that when clicked takes the player back to the title screen allowing them to play the game again.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Show final leaderboard after all players in the room finish level 4.
* [x] Order players based on their points accumulated across all races.
* [x] Add button that goes back to title screen.

## Development

### Outcome

On finishing this cycle, I have implemented the final leaderboard into the game that shows to players in the room after completing all four levels. This counts the total number of points for each player and uses it to determine overall positions of players, with the most number of points coming first and so on. I feel it would be important to have this leaderboard as an overall assessor of players' performance rather than relying on just leaderboards for each level.&#x20;

Firstly, I created a new scene for the final leaderboard which looks similar to the leaderboard scene created in [Cycle 21](2.2.21-cycle-21.md) but with the text "Final Leaderboard" at the top and the header for the points column reads just "Points" rather than "New Points".

{% code title="public/scenes/leaderboard.js" %}
```javascript
function finalLeaderboardScene() {
    socket.off()

    add([
        text("Final Leaderboard", { size: 72 }),
        color(160, 160, 160),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("top"),
        pos(center().x, 10)
    ])

    const positionText = add([
        text("Position\n", { size: 20 }),
        color(255, 255, 255),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        z(2),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x - 150, center().y)
    ])

    const usernameText = add([
        text("Username\n", { size: 20 }),
        color(255, 255, 255),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        z(2),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center())
    ])

    const pointsText = add([
        text("Total Points\n", { size: 20 }),
        color(255, 255, 255),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        z(2),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x + 150, center().y)
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, the game sends a request to the server asking for the final leaderboard. When it receives the response, it does the same as the level leaderboard, putting each value into its separate column.

{% code title="public/scenes/leaderboard.js" %}
```javascript
socket.emit('get final leaderboard')

socket.on('get final leaderboard', leaderboard => {
    add([
        rect(450, (leaderboard.length + 1) * 22),
        color(100, 100, 100),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        z(1),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x, center().y - 10)
    ])

    for (let i = 0; i < leaderboard.length; i++) {
        positionText.text += (i + 1) + "\n"
        usernameText.text += leaderboard[i].username + "\n"
        pointsText.text += leaderboard[i].points += "\n"
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

The server on receiving the request first compiles an array of all players and their total points by going through each member of the room, getting their username, going through each level leaderboard and adding the points for that username, and then pushing to the array.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('get final leaderboard', () => {
    const finalLeaderboard = []

    Object.keys(rooms[room].members).forEach(member => {
        const { username } = rooms[room].members[member]
            
        let points = 0

        rooms[room].leaderboards.forEach(leaderboard => {
            const index = leaderboard.findIndex(entry => entry.username === username)
            points += leaderboard[index].points
        })

        finalLeaderboard.push({
            username: username,
            points: points
        })
    })
```
{% endcode %}

However, this array is unordered. To order it, I implemented the bubble sort algorithm adapted to my situation. It goes through each player entry in the final leaderboard and checks the points with the next entry. If the points of the first entry are lower, the entries are swapped positions. This means when the game receives the leaderboard and runs through it the highest points will come first. The code keeps doing this until no swaps are reported, then breaks out of the loop.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
while (true) {
    let swapped = false

    for (let i = 0; i < finalLeaderboard.length - 1; i++) {
        if (finalLeaderboard[i].points < finalLeaderboard[i + 1].points) {
            const backup = finalLeaderboard[i]

            finalLeaderboard[i] = finalLeaderboard[i + 1]
            finalLeaderboard[i + 1] = backup

            swapped = true
        }
    }

    if (!swapped) {
        break
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
