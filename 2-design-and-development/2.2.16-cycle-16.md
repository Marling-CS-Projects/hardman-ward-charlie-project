# 2.2.16 Cycle 16: Fireball

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code for the fireball power-up. The purpose of this will be to attack nearby players and get ahead of them. On hitting a player, the fireball will explode which deducts 4 health points from the player and temporarily stops their car from moving.

The player will be able to activate their power-up by pressing the shift key. After this, for the fireball, they can click anywhere on the screen to choose where to aim. The fireball will move quickly in the direction. If it does not hit any players for 20 blocks, it will disappear to prevent lag.

### Objectives

* [x] Activate power-up on pressing shift.
* [x] Display split controls that follow the mouse around the screen.
* [x] Draw fireball near the player.
* [x] Continually move the fireball at high speed towards the target.
* [x] If the fireball hits a player that is not its sender, explode.
* [x] Any player caught in an explosion takes 4 health points damage.

### Usability Features

* Mechanics -> Fireball power-up used to attack other players.
* Mechanics -> When the power-up is activated, an event is broadcasted to all players in the room.
* Mechanics -> The game continually checks if the fireball hits a player.
* Effective -> Fireball power-up distracts other players.

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have implemented the first power-up into my game. This will allow players to inflict damage on one another within a close range which increases the competitiveness of the game as players can now affect one another's progress.

Firstly, I created a new function to spawn a fireball. It takes in the X and Y position it should spawn at, then the index of the sender to avoid exploding on touching them, and the speed to fire at.

{% code title="sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
function Fireball(x, y, sender, speed) {
    const fireball = add([
        sprite("powerup_fireball"),
        area(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(x, y),
        z(2),
        {
            speed: speed,
            sender: sender,
            distance: 0,
            maxDistance: 10000
        },
        "fireball"
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

The fireball will continually move by the given speed after spawning until it has gone a total of 10,000 pixels, then it will be destroyed. This is to prevent lag as chances are if a fireball has travelled 10,000 pixels it is unlikely to hit any player but will still take up resources in the game.

{% code title="sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
onUpdate(() => {
    fireball.pos.x += fireball.speed.x
    fireball.pos.y += fireball.speed.y

    fireball.distance += Math.sqrt(fireball.speed.x ** 2 + fireball.speed.y ** 2)

    if (fireball.distance > fireball.maxDistance) {
        destroy(fireball)
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, if the fireball hits a car it will first check if the index of the car is the same as the sender. If it is, it shouldn't explode; this is because the fireball actually collides with the sender's car when it first spawns as it spawns in the same position as the sender. If the car isn't the sender's, the fireball is destroyed and an explosion is added in its place, which lasts for three seconds before being destroyed.

```javascript
fireball.onCollide("car", car => {
    if (car.index != fireball.sender) {
        destroy(fireball)
        const explosion = add([
            sprite("explosion_small"),
            area(),
            anchor("center"),
            pos(car.pos.x, car.pos.y),
            z(3),
            "explosion"
        ])

        setTimeout(() => {
            destroy(explosion)
        }, 3000)
    }
})
```

Thirdly, I have updated the handleCollisions function I setup for the finish line in Cycle 12 to handle if the player's car collides with a small explosion from the fireball. If it does, the player will lose four health points.

{% code title="sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
function handleCollisions(car) {
    // previous collisions
    
    car.onCollide("explosion", () => {
        takeDamage(car, 4)
    })
}
```
{% endcode %}

Fourthly, my game continually listens for "shift" to be pressed. This is the key for activating power-up. I used a switch statement to check what power-up the player has.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
onKeyDown("shift", () => { // If shift key pressed down
    let fireballShot = false // Fireball hasn't already been shot

    if (myCar.powerup != null) { // Player has a power-up to use
        switch (myCar.powerup) {
            case "fireball":
```
{% endcode %}

Fifthly, if the player is found to have the fireball power-up, a crosshair is drawn in the middle of the screen that moves around with the mouse to allow the player to select their target for the fireball. Whenever the mouse moves, the aim moves to that position on the screen.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
// Draw crosshair aim in centre of screen
const aim = add([
    sprite("aim"),
    area(),
    fixed(),
    z(3),
    anchor("center"),
    pos(center())
])

onMouseMove(mpos => { // When mouse moves
    aim.moveTo(mpos.x, mpos.y) // Move aim to cursor
})
```
{% endcode %}

Sixthly, the player can throw the fireball by clicking on the target. When this happens, the crosshair is destroyed as it is no longer needed. The game then calculates the angle in radians the fireball will travel at as this will be needed for calculating the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) speeds.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Calculating the change in X and Y for the fireball</p></figcaption></figure>

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
onClick(() => { // When mouse is clicked
    if (!fireballShot) { // Fireball not already been shot
        destroy(aim) // Destroy crosshair

        const angle = Math.atan2(mousePos().y - myCar.screenPos().y, mousePos().x - myCar.screenPos().x) // Calculate angle for fireball to travel at
```
{% endcode %}

The game then broadcasts an event to all other players telling their games to spawn a fireball starting at the position of the sender's car along with the X and Y speeds and the index of the sender.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.emit('spawn fireball', {
    position: myCar.pos,
    speed: {
        x: Math.cos(angle) * speed,
        y: Math.sin(angle) * speed
    },
    sender: index
})

fireballShot = true
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('spawn fireball', data => {
    io.to(room).emit('spawn fireball', data)
})
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, on receiving an event to spawn a fireball, the game extracts the data and passes it into the Fireball function I created earlier. This spawns a fireball for all players in the room after a player activates the power-up.

{% code title="" %}
```javascript
socket.on('spawn fireball', data => {
    const { position, sender, speed} = data
    Fireball(position.x, position.y, sender, speed)
})
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

In this cycle, I did encounter one issue which is related to my use of the onClick function to shoot the fireball after aiming. In Kaboom.js, onClick sets up an event listener to whenever the player clicks on the screen, it executes a given piece of code; unfortunately this listener is permanent. Initially, this resulted in the player being able to fire an infinite amount of fireballs provided they once received the fireball power-up as the game was still listening for mouse clicks and executing the code to shoot the fireball.

I fixed this by adding a variable after the player receives a power-up known as fireballShot. This is by default set to false. When the player clicks to shoot their fireball, the code first checks this variable is false. If it's not, nothing happens, otherwise the code for shooting a fireball is executed and the variable is set to true, preventing the player from shooting another fireball until they get the power-up again.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
onKeyDown("shift", () => { // If shift key pressed down
    let fireballShot = false // Fireball hasn't already been shot

    if (myCar.powerup != null) { // Player has a power-up to use
            switch (myCar.powerup) {
                case "fireball":
                    // other stuff
                    
                    onClick(() => {
                        if (!fireballShot) {
                            // code to shoot fireball
                            
                            fireballShot = true // stop player shooting fireball again
                        }
                    })
```
{% endcode %}
