# 2.2.6 Cycle 6: Joining and creating rooms

## Design

In this cycle, I will be making another scene that lets the player choose if they want to join an existing room or create a new one. They will be able to input an 8 character code corresponding to a room. I will achieve this by drawing two rectangles in the same place, but one slightly smaller and darker, to create the look of an input box, along with placing text on top of them which is modified through pressing keys. This scene is accessed on clicking the play button on the title screen.

If the player decides to start a new room, the server will generate a random 8 character code consisting of both upper and lowercase letters and numbers. This code will be sent back to the client who will then attempt to join using it. For now, on joining a room, the code will just be outputted in the browser console. In the next cycle, I will add a waiting screen which is shown to all players in a room before the game starts, which shows the room code, a list of players, and a start game button.

There are certain restrictions on rooms. For example, each room can only contain up to five players. Therefore, if a player attempts to join a room that has already reached its limit, the server should send an error message and the client should be prepared to handle this and inform the player there was a problem joining. Additionally, the player may type in a room code that doesn't exist. The server should be prepared for this and return an error to the client.

### Objectives

* [x] Run Socket.IO server.
* [x] Create new scene "multiplayer".
* [x] Clicking play on the title screen goes to the multiplayer scene.
* [x] Allow the player to enter the room name of up to 8 characters.
* [x] Add buttons to join and create room.
* [x] When the join room button is clicked, send a Socket.IO event to the server with the entered room.
* [x] If certain conditions to join the room are not met, display an error message.
* [x] Join the room and send information back to the client.
* [x] When the new room button is clicked, send a Socket.IO event to the server.&#x20;
* [x] Continually generate 8 character code until a unique one is found, then join the room.
