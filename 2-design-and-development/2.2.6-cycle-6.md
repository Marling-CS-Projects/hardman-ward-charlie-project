# 2.2.6 Cycle 6: Joining and creating rooms

## Design

In this cycle, I will be making another scene that lets the player choose if they want to join an existing room or create a new one. They will be able to input an 8 character code corresponding to a room. I will achieve this by drawing two rectangles in the same place, but one slightly smaller and darker, to create the look of an input box, along with placing text on top of them which is modified through pressing keys. This scene is accessed on clicking the play button on the title screen.

If the player decides to start a new room, the server will generate a random 8 character code consisting of both upper and lowercase letters and numbers. This code will be sent back to the client who will then attempt to join using it. For now, on joining a room, the code will just be outputted in the browser console. In the next cycle, I will add a waiting screen which is shown to all players in a room before the game starts, which shows the room code, a list of players, and a start game button.

There are certain restrictions on rooms. For example, each room can only contain up to five players. Therefore, if a player attempts to join a room that has already reached its limit, the server should send an error message and the client should be prepared to handle this and inform the player there was a problem joining. Additionally, the player may type in a room code that doesn't exist. The server should be prepared for this and return an error to the client.

### Objectives

* [x] Run Socket.IO server.
* [x] Create new scene "multiplayer".
* [x] Clicking play on the title screen goes to the multiplayer scene.
* [x] Allow the player to enter the room name of up to 8 characters.
* [x] Add buttons to join and create room.
* [x] When the join room button is clicked, send a Socket.IO event to the server with the entered room.
* [x] If certain conditions to join the room are not met, display an error message.
* [x] Join the room and send information back to the client.
* [x] When the new room button is clicked, send a Socket.IO event to the server.&#x20;
* [x] Continually generate 8 character code until a unique one is found, then join the room.

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have added a new scene for creating and joining a room and implemented these functions through use of the Socket.IO library. This will allow real-time communication between clients in the same room, which is essential for this game because it is multiplayer.

Firstly, I setup the Socket.IO server. The client establishes a connection to the server if the get-username POST request setup in Cycle 4 was successful and then sends event "give username" before going to the title scene. On receiving this event, the server stores the username. This is more efficient than sending the username each time it is needed.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
const { Server } = require('socket.io') // Import Server class of Socket.IO library

const io = new Server(server) // Create new server running on HTTP server

io.on('connection', socket => { // Whenever a client connects to the server
    let username

    socket.on('give username', u => { // Store in variable when client sends username
        username = u
    })
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/index.js" %}
```javascript
let socket

$.post({
    url: "/get-username",
    data: {
        session: session
    },
    success: res => {
        username = res

        socket = io() // Establish connection to Socket.IO server
        socket.emit('give username', username) // Send username to server

        go("title")
    },
    error: () => {
        go("login info")
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/index.html" %}
```html
<script src="https://cdn.socket.io/4.6.0/socket.io.min.js"></script>
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, a new scene "multiplayer" is created. This scene will allow the player to enter in an 8 digit code and join an existing room, or alternatively they can create a new one.

{% code title="public/scenes/multiplayer.js" %}
```javascript
/* Multiplayer scene
- Shown after clicking play button
- Input box for entering room code
- Buttons to join room or create new room
- Instruction text for each option
*/

function multiplayerScene() {
    // Instruction text for joining a room
    add([
        text("Enter an eight-digit room code", { size: 20 }),
        color(150, 150, 150),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x, center().y - 160) // 160px above centre
    ])

    const roomInput = Input(center().x, center().y - 100) // Input for room code

    const joinRoomButton = Button(center().x, center().y, "Join Room") // Button to join room

    // Instruction text for creating a new room
    add([
        text("Or, create a new room", { size: 20 }),
        color(150, 150, 150),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(center().x, center().y + 100)
    ])

    const newRoomButton = Button(center().x, center().y + 160, "New Room") // Button to create new room
```
{% endcode %}

Similar to the Button function in Cycle 5 that draws a button in the specified place with a label, I created another function for an input box. It draws two rectangles in the same place to create the look of an input box and places text on top of it. The game continually listens for number and letter keys and adds them to the text until it reaches 8 characters. If the user presses backspace, the last character is removed.

```javascript
/* Function to draw an input box
- Continually check for characters to be entered
- Supported characters: upper and lowercase letters, and numbers
- Up to 8 characters
*/

function Input(x, y) {
    // 200x70 grey rectangle
    add([
        rect(220, 70),
        color(130, 130, 130),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(x, y)
    ])

    // 215x65 darker rectangle on top
    add([
        rect(215, 65),
        color(80, 80, 80),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(x, y)
    ])

    // White text on top
    const input = add([
        text("", { size: 20 }),
        color(255, 255, 255),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(x, y)
    ])

    /* Continually check for supported characters to be entered 
    - If shift key is pressed, add uppercase
    - Do not exceed 8 characters
    - If backspace pressed, delete last character of input
    */
    
    const chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890".split('')

    onKeyPress(k => {
        if (chars.includes(k)) {
            if (isKeyDown("shift")) { // Shift pressed
                k = k.toUpperCase() // Convert to uppercase
            }

            if (input.text.length < 8) { // If less than 8 characters in input
                input.text += k // Add to input
            }
        }

        if (k === "backspace") { // Backspace pressed
            input.text = input.text.substring(0, input.text.length - 1) // Delete last character
        }
    })

    return input
}
```

Thirdly, when the join room button is clicked, the client sends an event to the server using Socket.IO requesting to join the room. Before the player can join, a number of conditions must be fulfilled. These are: the room actually exists, the room does not already have five players in it, and the room has not already started playing.&#x20;

{% code title="public/scenes/multiplayer.js" %}
```javascript
joinRoomButton.onClick(() => { // Join button clicked
    if (roomInput.text.length == 8) { // Player has entered 8 character code
        socket.emit('join room', roomInput.text) // Ask server to join room
    }
})

socket.on('room error', err => { // Error occured joining room
    alert("Error joining room: " + err) // Display error in popup alert
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('join room', r => { // Client has requested to join room
    /* Check conditions for joining
    - Room exists
    - Room has less than 5 players already
    - Room has not started playing
    */
    
    if (!Object.keys(rooms).includes(r)) { // Room doesn't exist
        socket.emit('room error', 'Room does not exist.')
        return
    }
        
    if (Object.keys(rooms[r].members).length == 5) { // Room is full
        socket.emit('room error', 'Room is full.')
        return
    }

    if (rooms[r].started) { // Room has started playing
        socket.emit('room error', 'Room has already started playing.')
        return
    }
```
{% endcode %}

If those conditions are met, the room code is stored in a variable so it can be accessed at any time. An entry for the member, which has their Socket.IO ID, their username, and their index (number), is added to the list of members, and the player is joined into the room.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
room = r // Store room

// Add entry to room members
rooms[room].members[socket.id] = {
    username: username,
    index: Object.keys(rooms[room].members).length
}

// Join room and inform client
socket.join(room)
socket.emit('join room', room)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/multiplayer.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('join room', room => { // Successfully joined room
    console.log("You have joined room " + room) // Output message to console for now
})
```
{% endcode %}

Fourthly, when the new room button is clicked, an event is sent to the server asking to create a new room. The server continually generates an 8 character room code of letters and numbers until a unique one is found. While the chances of collision are relatively small, it's important to avoid the risk altogether.

{% code title="public/scenes/multiplayer.js" %}
```javascript
newRoomButton.onClick(() => {
    socket.emit('new room')
})
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('new room', () => { // Client requested to create new room
    /* Generate room code
    - 8 characters
    - Upper/lowercase letters and numbers
    - Continually generate until unique one found
    */
    
    const chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890" // Allowed characters

    let r

    // Continually generate code until unique one found
    do {
        r = "" // Set room to empty string

        // 8 random characters
        for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            r += chars[Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length)]
        }

        if (!Object.keys(rooms).includes(r)) { // Unique
            break // Stop loop
        }
    } while (true)
    
    rooms[r] = {
        members: {},
        started: false
    }
```
{% endcode %}

After the room is generated, it can be assumed the player would want to automatically join it. Therefore, the room code is sent back to the client using a Socket.IO event. On receiving the code, the client automatically requests to join.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
socket.emit('new room', r) // Send client their room code
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/multiplayer.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('new room', room => { // On receiving room, request to join
    socket.emit('join room', room)
})
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

The one issue I experienced in this cycle was with the input box. It could not detect when I was entering a capital letter by holding down the shift key, and just added the lowercase version. This is because the function onKeyPress records keys being pressed, not characters. As far as the function was concerned, I was pressing down the key for "a", not entering "A".&#x20;

{% code title="public/sprites/input.js" %}
```javascript
onKeyPress(k => {
    if (chars.includes(k) && input.text.length < 8) {
        input.text += k // Add to input
    }
```
{% endcode %}

Fortunately, this is partially possible to fix. Using isKeyDown, it is possible to check if a specific key is being held down. Therefore, the game can check if shift is being pressed down and convert the key to uppercase if so.

{% code title="public/sprites/input.js" %}
```javascript
if (chars.includes(k)) {
    if (isKeyDown("shift")) { // Shift pressed
        k = k.toUpperCase() // Convert to uppercase
}
```
{% endcode %}
