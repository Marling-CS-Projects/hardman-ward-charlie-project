# 2.2.18 Cycle 18: Potion effects

## Design

In this cycle I will be implementing the effects of potion power-ups. These will be speed, regeneration, and healing. Unlike fireball and TNT, these effects are intended to help the player rather than harm the other players.

The speed potion will increase the maximum speed at which the player can accelerate to by 50% which will last 10 seconds and can help them catch up with or overtake their opponents. On the other hand, the regeneration and healing potions are intended to help the player in scenarios of low health, with regeneration restoring 1 health point a second over 10 seconds and healing instantly restoring 3 health.

### Objectives

* [x] Potion of speed increases maximum speed for 10 seconds.
* [x] Potion of healing restores 3 health points instantly.
* [x] Potion of regeneration restores 1 health point every second for 10 seconds.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| maxSpeed      | Maximum speed the car can accelerate to.                 |
| health        | Health points of the player; when they reach 0 they die. |
| s             | Remaining seconds of the regeneration effect.            |

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have implemented three different potion effects and power-ups into my game: speed, healing, and regeneration. These will be useful for helping the player in a situation where they are running low on health or are behind other players.

The likelihood of the player getting a potion power-up is increased if they are not first (speed), or if their health is below 8 (healing) or below 5 (regeneration). These potions are intended to help the player in difficult situations.

Firstly, if the player activates the speed potion power-up, their car's maximum speed is changed to 15 from 10. A timeout is then set lasting 10 seconds. Once this timeout is finished the maximum speed goes back to 10.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
case "speed":                    
    myCar.maxSpeed = 15

    setTimeout(() => {
        myCar.maxSpeed = 10
    }, 10000)
    break
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, if the player activates the healing potion power up, three health points are given immediately. If this results in the player exceeding 10 health, it will immediately be set back to 10 as configured in [Cycle 14](2.2.15-cycle-14.md).

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
case "healing":
    myCar.health += 3
    break
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, if the player activates the regeneration potion power-up, 1 health point is given per second for 10 seconds. This is achieved through a recursive function which runs every second for 10 seconds. As with healing, the player's health points will not exceed 10 at any point.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
case "regeneration":
    function regenerate(s = 10) {
        if (s > 0) {
            myCar.health++
            setTimeout(() => {
                regenerate(s - 1)
            }, 1000)
        }
    }

    regenerate()
    break
```
{% endcode %}
