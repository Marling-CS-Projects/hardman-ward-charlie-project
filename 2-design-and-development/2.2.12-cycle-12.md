# 2.2.12 Cycle 12: Finish line

## Design

In [Cycle 8](2.2.8-cycle-8.md) I forgot to add the finish line. This will appear at the end of the racing track. When the player collides with the finish line, their car will stop accelerating and eventually come to a stop. Additionally, the stopwatch created in [Cycle 11](2.2.11-cycle-11.md) will stop counting anymore seconds and text saying "FINISH!" will appear for a few seconds in the centre of the screen. In a later cycle, I will add a level-specific leaderboard that shows after finish, which will display how each player performed in the specific level and their overall standing.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] During generation of the worlds, add finish line on the road near the end.
* [x] During rendering of the world, if the block is a chest or finish line, add a tag so the sprite can be identified.
* [x] When the player crosses the finish line, end the stopwatch, stop acceleration, and display text "FINISH!" for a few seconds.

    // loops
    
        if (y == 20):
            name = "road"

            name: name
            // other info
        })

{% endcode %}

{% code title="sprites/car.js" %}
```
func handleCollisions(car):
    car.onCollide("finish", func(): 
        car.acceleration = 0
        
        clearTimeout(s)
        
        finishText = addText("FINISH!", center())
        
        setTimeout(destroy(finishText), 5000)
    )
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}

socket.on('get numbers' func (data):
    // other stuff
    
    handleCollisions(myCar)
)
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have added the finish line which appears 20 blocks from the end of the road. I also added collision detection so the player stops moving, the stopwatch stops counting, and brief text shows when the player crosses the line. Having a point to stop is important for the feel of a racing game.

Firstly, I had to make some modifications to the world generation algorithm as well as the rendering. For the world generation, when the X value is in the road and the Y value is 20, finish will be placed there. I chose Y 20 because that is 20 blocks away from the end of the road which provides space so the player does not see the actual end of the world.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
/*
- If X is outside of road, block is surrounding.
- If X is inside of road, block is road.
- Z is 1 so it appears as the furthest back layer.
- If Y is 20 and X is inside the road, block is finish.
*/

world.push({
    name: (x < 8 || x > 12) ? main : (y == 20) ? "finish" : road,
    x: x,
    y: y,
    z: 1
})
```
{% endcode %}

In the world rendering in the game itself, I want a special tag to be assigned to finish blocks just like chests so that the game can check specifically for the player colliding with them.&#x20;

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
add([
    sprite(block.name),
    area(),
    pos(block.x * 100, block.y * 100), // Translate block co-ordinates to pixels (1 block = 100 pixels)
    z(block.z), // Layer of block; higher appear on top
    anchor("center"),
    "block",
    (block.name === "chest" || block.name === "finish") ? block.name : null
])
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, I have created a new function, handleCollision, which will contain the code to handle all collisions between the player's car and other sprites such as the finish line. When the player collides with the finish line, therefore meaning they crossed it, their acceleration is set to 0 meaning they will gradually come to a standstill, a custom event 'finish' is dispatched which will be used to end the stopwatch, and text "FINISH!" is displayed in the centre of the screen for five seconds.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
/* Detect and handle collision between player and other 
sprites */

function handleCollisions(car) {
    car.onCollide("finish", () => { // Player collides with finish line
        car.acceleration = 0 // Stop accelerating

        const finishEvent = new CustomEvent('finish') // Tell stopwatch to finish
        window.dispatchEvent(finishEvent)

        const finishText = add([
            text("FINISH!", { size: 144 }),
            area(),
            fixed(),
            z(3),
            anchor("center"),
            pos(center())
        ]) // Add FINISH text to screen

        setTimeout(() => {
            destroy(finishText)
        }, 5000) // Destroy finish text after 5 seconds
    })
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, when the player crosses the finish line, the stopwatch should stop counting. To achieve this, I added an event listener to the stopwatch code so that when the finish event takes place, the stopwatch stops updating.

{% code title="public/misc/stopwatch.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to start stopwatch
- Take a given stopwatch
- Increase seconds every second
- If seconds overflows, carry over to minutes
*/

function startStopwatch(stopwatch) {
    // previous code
    
    window.addEventListener('finish', () => { // When player finishes race
        clearTimeout(s) // Stop counting
    })
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

In this cycle I encountered one error. I originally planned to clear the timeout which updates the stopwatch every second directly from the collision handler for the player's car crossing finish. However the variable "s" where the timeout was stored was not accessible from that part of the code, resulting in a ReferenceError.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
/* Detect and handle collision between player and other 
sprites */

function handleCollisions(car) {
    car.onCollide("finish", () => { // Player collides with finish line
        clearTimeout(s) // Stop updating stopwatch
```
{% endcode %}

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: s is not defined
```

To resolve this, after crossing the finish line, I added a custom event "finish", which can be handled from anywhere in the code. Therefore, I setup an event listener in the stopwatch code that ends the stopwatch updates when the event takes place.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
car.onCollide("finish", () => { // Player collides with finish line
    const finishEvent = new CustomEvent('finish') // Tell stopwatch to finish
    window.dispatchEvent(finishEvent)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/misc/stopwatch.js" %}
```javascript
window.addEventListener('finish', () => { // When player finishes race
    clearTimeout(s) // Stop counting
})
```
{% endcode %}
