# 2.2.9 Cycle 9: Car movement and scrolling

## Design

In this cycle I will be adding car sprites for each player in the room. I have made five different car sprites of different colours: red, green, blue, yellow, and purple. Cars will be assigned in order of who joined first, for example the player who created the room will get the red car. The player can control their own car using WSAD and all changes in co-ordinates and rotation will be broadcast to all other players in the room so that they can update the position and angle of the corresponding car sprite.

### Objectives

* [x] Render a car for each room member.
* [x] Add acceleration, speed, maximum speed, and friction properties to the player's car.
* [x] Keys W and S move forward and reverse the car.
* [x] Keys A and D turn left and right the car.
* [x] Continually move the car forward using cos and sin functions to calculate the change in X and Y according to angle and speed.
* [x] Update the car's position and angle for all other players.
* [x] Render a car for each player that is in the room

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have added cars to the game along with controls for moving and turning the player's own car. Each car has its position and angle broadcasted to everyone in the room meaning the car is always in the same place and has the same angle for all the players.&#x20;

Firstly, I created a new function for the car sprite. It takes in three parameters: x, y, and index. The index is used to select the colour of a car, of which there are five. Then a car of that colour is drawn in the given co-ordinates. Its angle property is set to 0 so it can be rotated which will be necessary when developing the controls.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
/* Car sprite
- Select a colour using the index
- Draw car at given co-ordinates
- Set angle to 0 so it can be rotated
*/

function Car(x, y, index) {
    const colours = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"]

    return add([
        sprite("car_" + colours[index]),
        area(),
        body(),
        anchor("center"),
        pos(x, y),
        z(2),
        {
            angle: 0,
            index: index
        },
        "car"
    ])
}
```
{% endcode %}

The Car function is called in the level scene for the number of players in the room. For example, if there are five players, the Car function will be drawn five times.&#x20;

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
// Draw a car for each player in the room
for (let i = 0; i < total; i++) {
    Car(800 + (i * 100), 97000, i)
}
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, I created another function called addMechanics which will be used to add mechanics properties and set controls for the player's own car. It adds properties for forward, reverse, left, and right which are default set to false. When a control is set to true, the car will move or turn accordingly. It also adds properties for acceleration, speed, maximum speed, and friction.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
function addMechanics(car) {
    car.controls = {
        "forward": false,
        "reverse": false,
        "left": false,
        "right": false
    }

    car.acceleration = 0.2
    car.speed = 0
    car.maxSpeed = 10
    car.friction = 0.05
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, I setup key listeners that when any key is pressed down, they check if the key is one of WSAD and match it to its action. Then it sets that control to true. Similarly, if one of the keys is released, the control is set to false. This is much quicker than implementing each key and control (W for forward, A for left, etc) on its own.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
// Controls corresponding to WSAD keys
const keyDefinitions = {
    "w": "forward",
    "s": "reverse",
    "a": "left",
    "d": "right"
}

// If key corresponding to control pressed down, set it to true
onKeyDown(k => {
    if (Object.keys(keyDefinitions).includes(k)) {
        const control = keyDefinitions[k]
        car.controls[control] = true
    }
})

// If key corresponding to control released, set it to false
onKeyRelease(k => {
    if (Object.keys(keyDefinitions).includes(k)) {
        const control = keyDefinitions[k]
        car.controls[control] = false
    }
})
```
{% endcode %}

Fourthly, the game continually checks if the controls are active. If forward is active, which means W is being held down, the acceleration is added to the speed until it reaches the maximum. If reverse is active, the acceleration is subtracted until reaching negative half of maximum speed. If left or right is active, the angle is decremented and incremented respectively. Friction is constantly added or deducted to the speed depending on if it is positive or not so the car eventually stops if the player is not moving it.&#x20;

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
/* Continually check controls
- If forward is active, increase speed by acceleration.
- If reverse is active, decrease speed by acceleration.
- Do not exceed maximum speed or go below negative half 
of maximum speed.
- If left is active, decrement angle.
- If right is active, increment angle.
- Friction constantly pushes back a small amount on car.
- Use sin and cos functions to calculate change in
position.
*/

onUpdate(() => {
    if (car.controls.forward) {
        car.speed += car.acceleration
    }
    if (car.controls.reverse) {
        car.speed -= car.acceleration
    }

    if (car.controls.left) {
        car.angle--
    }
    if (car.controls.right) {
        car.angle++
    }

    if (car.speed > 0) {
        car.speed -= car.friction
    }
    if (car.speed < 0) {
        car.speed += car.friction
    }
    if (Math.abs(car.speed) < car.friction) { // If modulus of speed is less than friction
        car.speed = 0 // Set speed to 0 (stop moving)
    }

    if (car.speed > car.maxSpeed) {
        car.speed = car.maxSpeed
    }
    if (car.speed < -car.maxSpeed / 2) {
        car.speed = -car.maxSpeed / 2
    }
```
{% endcode %}

After determining what speed the car will move at, I made use of the sin and cos functions of the built-in "Math" JavaScript library to calculate the change in position for both X and Y of the car. After moving, the camera position is updated so to centre the track and keep the player's car near the bottom of the screen. The game then broadcasts the change in co-ordinates to other clients in the room.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
// Move the car according to the angle and speed
car.pos.x += Math.sin(toRadians(car.angle)) * car.speed
car.pos.y -= Math.cos(toRadians(car.angle)) * car.speed

camPos(1000, car.pos.y - 200) // Update camera position

// Inform other clients of new position and angle
socket.emit('update car', {
    position: car.pos,
    angle: car.angle
})
```
{% endcode %}

Fifthly, back in the level scene, the game stores the player's car in a separate variable and passes it into the addMechanics function to enable player control of it.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
myCar = get("car")[index] // Store player's own car in separate variable
addMechanics(myCar) // Enable controls and movement
```
{% endcode %}

When the client receives the event that another player has moved or turned, that car's position and angle are updated to reflect the new values.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('update car', data => { // Another player has moved or turned
    const { index, position, angle } = data

    const otherCar = get("car")[index]

    // Set position and angle of that car to new values
    otherCar.angle = angle
    otherCar.pos.x = position.x
    otherCar.pos.y = position.y
})
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

In this cycle, when I implemented sin and cos for diagonal movement if the car was rotated, I encountered an issue where the car would move in completely random (at least from my perspective) directions. This resulted from the fact that my car's angles were in the form of degrees, but the built-in sin and cos functions took angles as radians.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
// Move the car according to the angle and speed
car.pos.x += Math.sin(car.angle) * car.speed
car.pos.y -= Math.cos(car.angle) * car.speed
```
{% endcode %}

I fixed this by writing a function to convert degrees to radians. I can substitute this in to any function that takes radians as input to convert degrees to radians and get my desired result.

{% code title="public/util.js" %}
```javascript
// Function to convert degrees to radians
function toRadians(angle) {
    return angle * (Math.PI / 180);
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
// Move the car according to the angle and speed
car.pos.x += Math.sin(toRadians(car.angle)) * car.speed
car.pos.y -= Math.cos(toRadians(car.angle)) * car.speed
```
{% endcode %}
