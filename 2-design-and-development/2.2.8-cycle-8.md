# 2.2.8 Cycle 8: World generation and rendering

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the server code for generating the world for each level. The world will be generated on the server to alleviate the pressure on client machines that may be less capable of performing such a task within a reasonable time period, and to allow randomly-decided aspects of the world, such as the scattering of power-up chests, to stay the same for all players in the room.

Every level will be set in a different environment and contain blocks for the road, which will be in the middle of the world, along with its surroundings. Chests and props, such as trees, will be randomly scattered in the relevant parts of the world to make the player experience feel more unique each time they play.

I will also be writing the code for the game rendering the world. Because rendering everything at once would lead to enormous amounts of lag and make the game unplayable, I have decided to only render parts of the world that fit in the game's camera. This will significantly reduce lag and make the game more efficient in terms of performance.

### Objectives

* [x] When a new room is created, generate four levels with a different road and surrounding block, and prop, for each.
* [x] Generate first layer of the world with road block (e.g. dirt) in the middle and surrounding block (e.g. grass) surrounding.
* [x] Scatter 1000 of prop (e.g. trees) on both sides of the road.
* [x] Scatter 300 chests on the road itself.
* [x] Set camera position so the road is in the horizontal middle of the screen.
* [x] Continually destroy and draw new blocks that fit within the camera position.
* [x] Generate the first layer of the world, this will include the block for the surroundings (e.g. grass) and for the road (e.g. dirt).

            world.add({
                name: x < 8 or x > 12 then: main else: road,
                x: x,

    update:
        destroyTag("block")
        
        top = (camPosY - (height / 2)) / 100
        bottom = (camPosY + (height / 2)) / 100
        left = (camPosX - (width / 2)) / 100
        right = (camPosX + (width / 2)) / 100
        
        for block in world:
            if block.x >= left and block.x <= right and block.y >= top and block.y <= bottom:
                add([
                    sprite(block.name),
                    area(),
                    pos(block.x * 100, block.y * 100),
                    z(block.z),
                    anchor("center"),
                    "block"
                ])
        
        socket.emit('load world')
        
    socket.on('load world', func (w):
        world = w
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have written functions to generate the world and scatter various props such as trees and chests. The random placing of props makes the game more replayable as the world will look different and the chests will be in different places every time.

Firstly, the worlds for the four levels are generated as soon as the room is created. This is done using the World function. This takes in three parameters: the surrounding block, the road block, and a prop. For example, in the first level, the surrounding block is grass, the road block dirt, and the prop trees.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
rooms[r] = {
    members: {},
    worlds: [
        World("grass", "dirt", "tree"),
        World("sand", "sandstone", "cacti"),
        World("redsand", "terracota", "deadbush"),
        World("snow", "stone", "sprucetree")
    ],
    started: false
}
```
{% endcode %}

The World function generates a world of 20 blocks along and 1000 blocks down. Given each block will be 100x100, this amounts to a total of 2000x100000 pixels, which works for most screen resolutions and provides a reasonably long racetrack. When deciding what block to push to the world array, the function makes use of a ternary operator to decide whether to place the surrounding or road block.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function for generating world
- Takes surrounding block, road block, and prop as parameters.
- Generates 20x1000 block world with road in the horizontal middle.
- Scatters given prop on the surroundings.
- Scatters chest on the road.
*/

function World(surrounding, road, prop) {
    const world = []

    for (let y = 0; y < 1000; y++) { // 1000 blocks down
        for (let x = 0; x < 20; x++) { // 20 blocks across
            /*
            - If X is outside of road, block is surrounding.
            - If X is inside of road, block is road.
            - Z is 1 so it appears as the furthest back layer.
            */
            
            world.push({
                name: (x < 8 || x > 12) ? surrounding : road,
                x: x,
                y: y,
                z: 1
            })
        }
    }
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, the function addProps is called three times, twice for adding the given prop such as trees to the surroundings and once for adding chests to the road. The function takes in the world to be modified, the name of the prop, how many of the prop, and the starting and ending X co-ordinate of the area affected. After this the world is returned.

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
// Add props to world

addProps(world, prop, 1000, 0, 7)

addProps(world, "chest", 200, 8, 12)

addProps(world, prop, 1000, 13, 20)

return world
```
{% endcode %}

The addProps function randomly calculates X and Y values, for the former taking into account the start and end of the region, and adds them to the world.&#x20;

{% code title="server.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to add specified prop to a part of the world
- Runs for the amount of props given
- Randomly generates X and Y
- Adds entry to the world for the prop
- Z is 2 so it appears on top of the base layer.
*/

function addProps(world, prop, number, startX, endX) {
    for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        let x = randomBetween(startX, endX) // Generate random number between start and end of region
        let y = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) // Generate random number between 0 and 999

        world.push({
            x: x,
            y: y,
            z: 2,
            name: prop
        })
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Thirdly, in the level scene, which is the gameplay itself, the game requests to the server to load the world. I originally planned on doing this continually so it would receive updates automatically if anything changed, such as a chest being deleted on player collision, but this led to lag, so the game loads it once at the start.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
function levelScene() {
    let world = []

    socket.emit('load world') // Request for world
    
    socket.on('load world', w => { // On receiving world
        world = w // Set world variable
    })
```
{% endcode %}

Fourthly, because the world cannot all be rendered at once due to the immense lag it would cause, only blocks that would be visible by the game camera are rendered. This happens continually and all other blocks are destroyed so those no longer needed do not waste resources. The game calculates the furthest block to the top, left, right, and bottom that can be seen and only renders blocks that fit within those limits.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
/* Continually render the world
- Calculate the furthest top, bottom, left, and right blocks
visible.
- Go through each block in the world, if it fits within those
limits, then render it.
- Destroy unneeded blocks to reduce the strain on resources.
*/

onUpdate(() => {
    destroyAll("block")

    // Calculate furthest top, bottom, left, right blocks visible by camera
    const top = (camPos().y - (height() / 2) - 100) / 100
    const bottom = (camPos().y + (height() / 2) + 100) / 100
    const left = (camPos().x - (width() / 2) - 100) / 100
    const right = (camPos().x + (width() / 2) + 100) / 100

    world.forEach(block => {
        // Check if block fits within horizontal and vertical limits
        const fitsHorizontally = block.x >= left && block.x <= right
        const fitsVertically = block.y >= top && block.y <= bottom

        if (fitsHorizontally && fitsVertically) { // Block is visible
            add([
                sprite(block.name),
                area(),
                pos(block.x * 100, block.y * 100), // Translate block co-ordinates to pixels (1 block = 100 pixels)
                z(block.z), // Layer of block; higher appear on top
                anchor("center"),
                "block",
                (block.name === "chest") ? block.name : null // If block is a chest, add tag
            ])
        }
    })
})
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

In this cycle, when I attempted my initial idea of the game continually requesting an updated world, this resulted in a lot of lag in loading, presumably due to the server becoming so overwhelmed by requests.&#x20;

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
onUpdate(() => {
    // render world
    
    socket.emit('load world') // Request update for world
    
    socket.on('load world', w => { // On receiving world
        world = w // Set world variable
    })
})
```
{% endcode %}

I wanted to continually update the world so that in any scenario where the world is modified later on in development, such as picking up a chest, changes would be automatic. However, given the lag made the game unplayable, I ultimately gave up in favour of only reloading the world when necessary.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.emit('load world') // Request for world

socket.on('load world', w => { // On receiving world
    world = w // Set world variable
})

onUpdate(() => {
    // render world
})
```
{% endcode %}
