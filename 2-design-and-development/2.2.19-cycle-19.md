# 2.2.19 Cycle 19: Blindness

## Design

In this cycle, I will be implementing the blindness power-up, which covers the screens of all other players in black for a few seconds before quickly fading away.&#x20;

Like the fireball and TNT created in [Cycle 16](2.2.16-cycle-16.md) and [17](2.2.17-cycle-17.md), blindness is intended to be a distraction as it temporarily stops other players from seeing which is important on the road as players need to see what is around them.
