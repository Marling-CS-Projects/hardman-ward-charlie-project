# 2.2.19 Cycle 19: Blindness

## Design

In this cycle, I will be implementing the blindness power-up, which covers the screens of all other players in black for a few seconds before quickly fading away.&#x20;

Like the fireball and TNT created in [Cycle 16](2.2.16-cycle-16.md) and [17](2.2.17-cycle-17.md), blindness is intended to be a distraction as it temporarily stops other players from seeing which is important on the road as players need to see what is around them.

### Objectives

* [x] Cover screen of all other players with black when a player activates blindness.
* [x] After a few seconds, decrease the opacity of the black so the player can see through it.
* [x] After a couple more seconds, get rid of the black.

### Usability Features

* Mechanics -> Blindness power-up.
* Mechanics -> Broadcast updates to room.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| count         | Number of half seconds the player has been blind. Stops at 8. |
| opacity       | How opaque the black rectangle is.                            |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="" %}
```
switch myCar.powerup:
    case "blindness":
        emit('blindness')
        
on('blindness', func():
    func updateBlindness(count default 0):
        destroy("blindness")
    
        if count < 8:
            rectangle width, height, colour black, opacity (count <= 5) then 1 else 1 - (0.05 - (count - 5)), tag "blindness"
            
            timeout updateBlindness, args count + 1, ms 500
            
    updateBlindness()
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have implemented the blindness effect and power-up into my game, which temporarily covers the screens of other players in black, which helps the player as other players will be unable to see things such as monster armies and TNT for a short period of time.

Firstly, when the player activates the blindness power-up, their game broadcasts an event to all other clients in the room that will tell their games to give the player blindness.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
switch (myCar.powerup) {
    case "blindness":
        socket.emit('blindness') // Tell other players' games to give them blindness
        break
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, when the blindness event is received by the player, a recursive function is used to draw a black rectangle that is the width and height of the screen on top of everything. This function is executed every 500 milliseconds (half a second) eight times. If the count (number of times the function has run) is less than or equal to 5, the opacity of the rectangle is set to 1, meaning the player can't see anything, otherwise it is slightly more transparent. After eight times the rectangle is destroyed and the player can see again.

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('blindness', () => { // Another player has activated blindness
    function updateBlindness(count = 0) {
        destroyAll("blindness") // Destroy any previous black rectangles

        if (count < 8) { // This has ran less than 8 times (4 seconds)
            add([
                rect(width(), height()),
                color(0, 0, 0),
                // Opaque for the first five times (2.5 seconds), then slightly transparent for the rest
                opacity((count <= 5) ? 1 : 1 - (0.05 * (count - 5))),
                area(),
                fixed(),
                z(3),
                "blindness"
            ])

            setTimeout(() => {
                updateBlindness(count + 1)
            }, 500) // Run again after 500 milliseconds with count increased by 1
        }
    }

    updateBlindness()
})
```
{% endcode %}
