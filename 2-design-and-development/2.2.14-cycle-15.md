# 2.2.15 Cycle 15: Getting powerups from chest

## Design

In this cycle, I will be writing the code to detect when the player collides with a chest. I will take into account factors such as the player's position in the race implemented in [Cycle 13](2.2.13-cycle-13.md) and the amount of health the player has setup in [Cycle 14](2.2.15-cycle-14.md). This means for example if the player is far behind they are more likely to get a speed potion and if they are low health they are more likely to get a regeneration or healing potion.

### Objectives

* [ ] When a player collides with the chest, delete the chest from the map.
* [ ] Pick a random power-up from a list.
* [ ] Certain factors increase the likelihood of certain power-ups being selected.
