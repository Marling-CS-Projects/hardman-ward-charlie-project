# 2.2.10 Cycle 10: Race countdown

## Design

In this cycle, I will be developing the countdown which is displayed on the player's screen. It will go down from 3 and the player will not be able to move their car while it is still in action. After the countdown is finished, a custom event will be broadcasted which will enable the keyboard controls used to move the car. This will involve modifications to the mechanics of the car sprite so the key listeners are only activated after receiving the event.

### Objectives

* [x] Display large text in the centre of the screen to count down.
* [x] Count down from 3, updating the text.
* [x] When the count down finishes, update the text to say "GO!"
* [x] When the count down finishes, start listening for WSAD controls to move/turn car.
