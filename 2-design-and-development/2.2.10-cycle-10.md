# 2.2.10 Cycle 10: Race countdown

## Design

In this cycle, I will be developing the countdown which is displayed on the player's screen. It will go down from 3 and the player will not be able to move their car while it is still in action. After the countdown is finished, a custom event will be broadcasted which will enable the keyboard controls used to move the car. This will involve modifications to the mechanics of the car sprite so the key listeners are only activated after receiving the event.

### Objectives

* [x] Display large text in the centre of the screen to count down.
* [x] Count down from 3, updating the text.
* [x] When the count down finishes, update the text to say "GO!"
* [x] When the count down finishes, start listening for WSAD controls to move/turn car.

### Usability Features

* User interface -> Large text appears in centre of screen for countdown.
* Mechanics -> Player cannot move until countdown finished.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| s             | Number of seconds remaining in the countdown. |
| goEvent       | Event to start the race.                      |
| countdown(s)  | Function to start a countdown.                |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="misc/countdown.js" %}
```
func countdown(s default 3):
    destroy "countdown"
    
    if s >= 0:
        text s or "GO!", pos center, tag "countdown"
        
        timeout countdown, args s - 1, ms 1000
    
    else:
        dispatchevent 'go'
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="scenes/level.js" %}
```
on('get room numbers', func (data):
    // other stuff
    
    countdown()
)
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="sprites/car.js" %}
```
func addMechanics(car):
    // other stuff
    
    onEvent('go', func ():
        onKeyDown(func (k): 
            // handle key presses
        )
        
        onKeyRelease(func (k):
            // handle key releases
        )
    )
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have setup the countdown timer for the start of the race. I have also moved the key listeners for car movement so they are only activated after the race begins, meaning the players cannot move until the race has started.

Firstly, I wrote a function for countdown that takes in one parameter for seconds left. This parameter is set to 3 if not specified. It destroys previous countdown text if there was any and adds new text to the centre of the screen with the seconds left, or "GO!" if seconds is 0.

{% code title="public/misc/countdown.js" %}
```javascript
/* Countdown function
- Starting value of 3
- Display in centre of the screen
- Go down to 0
- Show "GO!" once finished
*/

function countdown(s = 3) {
    destroyAll("countdown") // Destroy previous text for countdown

    if (s >= 0) { // More than or 0 seconds left
        add([
            text(s || "GO!", { size: 144 }), // Display seconds or "GO!" if 0
            color(180, 180, 180),
            area(),
            fixed(),
            z(3),
            anchor("center"),
            pos(center()),
            "countdown"
        ])
```
{% endcode %}

If seconds is more than or equal to 0, the function will then repeat in a second with a decremented seconds value. If there were 3 seconds one time around, the next time the function runs it will be 2 seconds.&#x20;

{% code title="public/misc/countdown.js" %}
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    countdown(s - 1)
}, 1000) // Run again in one second with decremented seconds
```
{% endcode %}

On the other hand, if the seconds is now below 0, meaning the countdown is over, the function dispatches a custom event 'go' to the page. This can be received anywhere in the code.

{% code title="public/misc/countdown.js" %}
```javascript
else { // Countdown has finished
    // Send custom event to page
    const goEvent = new CustomEvent('go')
    window.dispatchEvent(goEvent)
}
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, the addMechanics function of the car must be modified slightly. In [Cycle 9](2.2.9-cycle-9.md), the key listeners for WSAD started immediately; but now I only want the car to move after the countdown is finished. I can achieve this by putting them inside an event listener for the 'go' event.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
// After countdown has finished, enable WSAD controls
window.addEventListener("go", () => {
    // If key corresponding to control pressed down, set it to true
    onKeyDown(k => {
        if (Object.keys(keyDefinitions).includes(k)) {
            const control = keyDefinitions[k]
            car.controls[control] = true
        }
    })

    // If key corresponding to control released, set it to false
    onKeyRelease(k => {
        if (Object.keys(keyDefinitions).includes(k)) {
            const control = keyDefinitions[k]
            car.controls[control] = false
        }
    })
})
```
{% endcode %}
