# 2.2.13 Cycle 13: Position indicator

## Design

In this cycle, I will be adding text to the bottom left of the screen showing what position in the race the player is. The game will continually compare the Y co-ordinate player's car to all other cars to calculate the player's position. If two cars have the same Y co-ordinate, which will be the case before the race starts, the indexes of the cars will be compared instead, with the car with the lowest index being awarded the best position. For example, if a car with index 0 and a car with index 1 were at the same Y co-ordinate, car 0 would be 1st place.

### Objectives

* [x] Add text for the position indicator to the bottom left of the screen. Set it to the player's index add 1 to start.&#x20;
* [x] After the countdown has finished, continually compare the Y co-ordinate of the other cars to that of the player.
* [x] Create a variable for position, with a starting value of 1.
* [x] If the other car's Y co-ordinate is less than the player's, increase the position by 1.
* [x] If the other car's Y co-ordinate is equal to that of the player's, compare their index. If the other car has a lower index, increase the position by 1.
* [x] Update the position indicator with the new position.

Test 2: After the race has started, the player's car's Y co-ordinate is continually compared to other cars to determine the player's position which is shown in the bottom left of the screen.
