# 2.2.13 Cycle 13: Position indicator

## Design

In this cycle, I will be adding text to the bottom left of the screen showing what position in the race the player is. The game will continually compare the Y co-ordinate player's car to all other cars to calculate the player's position. If two cars have the same Y co-ordinate, which will be the case before the race starts, the indexes of the cars will be compared instead, with the car with the lowest index being awarded the best position. For example, if a car with index 0 and a car with index 1 were at the same Y co-ordinate, car 0 would be 1st place.

### Objectives

* [x] Display text at the bottom left of the screen.
* [x] Set the indicator text to the index of the player added to 1 by default.
* [x] Continually compare player's Y co-ordinate to other players to determine the position.

### Usability Features

* User interface -> Position indicator appears in large text at bottom left of screen.
* User interface -> Player positions will be displayed on the leaderboard when it is implemented.
* Mechanics -> Positions of cars continually compared to see who is in front.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| position      | Calculate the position of the car.                                           |
| otherCar      | Car to be compared to the player's.                                          |
| index         | If two cars have the same Y position, whoever has the lowest index is ahead. |
| pos.y         | Y position of the car.                                                       |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="public/misc/posindicator.js" %}
```
func PositionIndicator(car, index):
    positionIndicator = text empty, pos 60, height - 40
    
    loop:
        position = 1
        
        for otherCar in tag("car"):
            if otherCar.index not index:
                if otherCar.y < car.y:
                    position++
                    
                if otherCar.y == car.y AND otherCar.index == index:
                    position++
                    
        positionIndicator.text set position
        
    return positionIndicator
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```
on('get room numbers', func (data):
    positionIndicator = PositionIndicator(myCar, index)
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have added a position indicator which lets the players see what position they are in the race. This is important to give the feel of a racing game. Later on in development when I add power-ups from chests, it will be taken into account to decide whether the player should be more likely to get certain power-ups such as the speed potion.

Firstly, I have written a new function for creating and updating the position indicator with the player's position in the race. The function takes in two parameters, the player's car and their index, which are important so the player's Y co-ordinate can be compared with that of other cars, and if the player has the same Y value as another car (such as before the race starts) the index will be used instead to determine who is in front.

{% code title="public/misc/posindicator.js" %}
```javascript
/* Position indicator
- Add indicator text to the bottom left of the screen
- Continually compare the player's Y co-ordinate to others
to determine who is front
- Update the indicator to display the player's position
- If the player's car has the same Y as another car, the car 
with the lowest index is in front
*/

function PositionIndicator(car, index) {
    // Add position text to bottom left of screen
    const positionIndicator = add([
        text("", { size: 200 }),
        color(181, 148, 16),
        area(),
        fixed(),
        anchor("botleft"),
        z(3),
        pos(60, height() - 40)
    ])
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly the code continually checks through each car and compares its Y value to the player's. If the Y value is lower, that means they are ahead of the player and therefore add 1 on to the player position, which starts at 1. However, if the player has the same Y as another player, the indexes are used to determine who is first. In practice it is very unlikely two players would share the same Y besides before the race starts.

{% code title="public/misc/posindicator.js" %}
```javascript
/* Continually update the player's position
- Assume player is 1st
- Check each other car and compare its Y to the player's
- If the Y is lower than the player's, add 1 to position
- If Y match, compare the indexes. If the player's index
is higher, add 1.
- Set text on position indicator
*/

onUpdate(() => {
    let position = 1 // Assume position of 1

    // Go through other cars to see if they are in front
    get("car").forEach(otherCar => {
        if (otherCar.index !== index) { // Car is not the player's
            if (otherCar.pos.y < car.pos.y) { // Other car's Y is less, meaning they are ahead
                position++ // Increase position
            }

            if (otherCar.pos.y == car.pos.y) { // Y are the same for both cars
                if (otherCar.index < index) { // Other player's index is less than players
                    position++ // Increase position
                }
            }
        }
    })

    positionIndicator.text = position // Set new position indicator text
})
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, after the game receives information about the number of players in the room and the index of the player from the server, the PositionIndicator function is called after storing the player's car in the myCar variable, passing in myCar and the index.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
socket.on('get room numbers', data => {
    // get player's car

    positionIndicator = PositionIndicator(myCar, index) // Create position indicator
})
```
{% endcode %}
