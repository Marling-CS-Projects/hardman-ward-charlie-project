# 2.2.13 Cycle 13: Position indicator

## Design

In this cycle, I will be adding text to the bottom left of the screen showing what position in the race the player is. The game will continually compare the Y co-ordinate player's car to all other cars to calculate the player's position. If two cars have the same Y co-ordinate, which will be the case before the race starts, the indexes of the cars will be compared instead, with the car with the lowest index being awarded the best position. For example, if a car with index 0 and a car with index 1 were at the same Y co-ordinate, car 0 would be 1st place.

### Objectives

* [x] Display text at the bottom left of the screen.
* [x] Set the indicator text to the index of the player added to 1 by default.
* [x] Continually compare player's Y co-ordinate to other players to determine the position.

Test 2: After the race has started, the player's car's Y co-ordinate is continually compared to other cars to determine the player's position which is shown in the bottom left of the screen.
