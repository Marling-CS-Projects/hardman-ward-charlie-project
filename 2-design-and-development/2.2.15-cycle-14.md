# 2.2.14 Cycle 14: Health bar

## Design

In this cycle, I will be setting up the player's health bar. The player will have ten health points, each represented by a red heart. Health points the player has lost will be represented by dark grey hearts. For example, a player with 7 health points would have 7 red hearts and 3 dark grey hearts.&#x20;

When the player runs out of health points, they will die which will involve the screen turning black and slowly fading back in over a period of ten seconds during which the player will be unable to move their car.

### Objectives

* [x] Add health property to the player with value of 10.
* [x] Continually destroy and draw hearts representing the health points.
* [x] Draw red hearts for each health point the player still has.
* [x] Draw grey hearts for health points the player has lost.
* [x] When the player runs out of health (dies), stop them moving.
* [x] Cover the screen in black and slowly fade away over 10 seconds.
* [x] Restore 1 health point a second.
* [x] After reviving, allow the player to move again.

### Pseudocode

{% code title="sprites/car.js" %}
```
func setupHealth(car):
    car.health = 10
    
    update:
        if car.health < 0:
            car.health = 0
            
        if car.health > 10:
            car.health = 10
            
        destroySprites("heart")
        
        for i in range(0, 10):
            add({
                sprite: (i < car.health) then "heart" else "heart_empty",
                fixed,
                pos: {
                    x: 20 + (i * 30),
                    y: 20,
                    z: 3
                },
                "heart"
            })
            
        if car.health == 0:
            die(car)
            
func die(car):
    car.acceleration = 0
    car.speed = 0
    car.angle = 0
    
    function revive(o = 1):
        destroySprites("black")
        
        add({
            rectangle: screenWidth, screenHeight,
            colour: black,
            fixed,
            opacity: o,
            pos: {
                x: 0,
                y: 0,
                z: 4
            },
            "black"
        })
        
        car.health++
        
        if o > 0:
            setTimeout(revive, args = o - 0.1, 1000)
        else:
            car.acceleration = 0.2
            
    revive()
```
