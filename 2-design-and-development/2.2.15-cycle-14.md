# 2.2.14 Cycle 14: Health bar

## Design

In this cycle, I will be setting up the player's health bar. The player will have ten health points, each represented by a red heart. Health points the player has lost will be represented by dark grey hearts. For example, a player with 7 health points would have 7 red hearts and 3 dark grey hearts.&#x20;

When the player runs out of health points, they will die which will involve the screen turning black and slowly fading back in over a period of ten seconds during which the player will be unable to move their car.

### Objectives

* [x] Add health property to the player with value of 10.
* [x] Continually destroy and draw hearts representing the health points.
* [x] Draw red hearts for each health point the player still has.
* [x] Draw grey hearts for health points the player has lost.
* [x] When the player runs out of health (dies), stop them moving.
* [x] Cover the screen in black and slowly fade away over 10 seconds.
* [x] Restore 1 health point a second.
* [x] After reviving, allow the player to move again.

### Usability Features

* Mechanics -> Health points.
* User interface -> Health bar.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| health        | Number of health points of the player. |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="sprites/car.js" %}
```
func setupHealth(car):
    car.health set 10
    
    loop:
        if car.health < 0:
            car.health set 0
            
        if car.health > 10:
            car.health set 10
            
        destroy "heart"
        
        for i in range(0, 10):
            sprite (i < car.health) then "heart" else "heart empty", fixed true, pos 20 + (i * 30), 20, z 3, tag "heart"
            
        if car.health == 0:
            die(car)
            
func die(car):
    car.acceleration set 0
    car.speed set 0
    car.angle set 0
    
    function revive(o default 1):
        destroy "black"
        
        rectangle width, height, fixed true, colour black, opacity o, pos x, y, z 4, tag "black"
        
        car.health++
        
        if o > 0:
            timeout revive, args o - 0.1, ms 1000
        else:
            car.acceleration set 0.2
            
    revive()
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

On completion of this cycle, I have setup the health bar for the player and also added death in case the player runs out of health points. This gives the player an incentive not to get injured when I add combat power-ups such as fireballs and TNT later on as if the player dies, they will be unable to move their car for 10 seconds which could give other players time to overtake them.

Firstly, I created a new function in the car.js file called setupHealth, which takes the player's car sprite as a parameter. It adds a property "health" to the car which has a starting value of 10. The game continually destroys all hearts to prevent lag and draws new ones for each health point the player has. For any missing health points an empty heart is drawn. Additionally, the game will prevent health going below 0 or exceeding 10.

{% code title="public/sprites/car.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to setup health bar
- Give the player a starting value of 10 health points
- Prevent health from going below 0 or above 10
- Draw hearts for each health point
- Draw empty hearts for any missing points
*/

function setupHealth(car) {
    car.health = 10 // Starting value of 10

    // Continually update health bar
    
    onUpdate(() => {
        if (car.health < 0) { // If health goes below 0, set back to 0
            car.health = 0
        }

        if (car.health > 10) { // If health goes above 10, set back to 10
            car.health = 10
        }

        destroyAll("heart") // Destroy all existing hearts to stop lag
        
        // Draw hearts depending on health points
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            add([
                sprite(i < car.health ? "heart" : "heart_empty"),
                area(),
                fixed(),
                z(3),
                pos(20 + (i * 30), 20),
                "heart"
            ])
        }

        if (car.health == 0) { // If health reaches 0, die
            die(car)
        }
    })
}
```
{% endcode %}

Secondly, I added a function for the player to die. When the player's health reaches 0, they will die, which means their car will become still immediately and reset to face forward if at an angle. Blackness covers the screen which gradually gets more transparent until it is gone after 10 seconds. Every second, a health point is restored.&#x20;

{% code title="public/scenes/car.js" %}
```javascript
/* Function to die
- When the player health reaches 0, this function is called
- The player's car is frozen for 10 seconds
- Blackness covers the screen and fades away over 10 seconds
- 1 health point restored a second
*/

function die(car) {
    // Set speed and acceleration to 0 so player stops moving
    car.acceleration = 0
    car.speed = 0
    car.angle = 0 // Car facing forward
    car.dead = true

    /* Recursive function to revive player
    - Blackness over screen
    - Fades away each second until gone
    - 1 health point restored a second
    - Once finished, restore acceleration to allow player
    to move again
    */
    
    function revive(o = 1) {
        car.health++

        destroyAll("black") // Get rid of previous blackness

        add([
            rect(width(), height()),
            color(0, 0, 0),
            opacity(o),
            area(),
            fixed(),
            pos(0, 0),
            z(4),
            "black"
        ]) // Add blackness over entire screen with specified opacity

        if (o > 0) { // Player still reviving
            setTimeout(() => {
                revive(o - 0.1)
            }, 1000) // Run again with 0.1 less opacity in a second
        } else { // Reviving finished
            car.acceleration = 0.2 // Restore acceleration
            car.dead = false
        }
    }

    revive()
}
```
{% endcode %}

Finally, setupHealth is called alongside other functions relating to the player's car in the level scene.

{% code title="public/scenes/level.js" %}
```javascript
myCar = get("car")[index] // Store player's own car in separate variable
addMechanics(myCar) // Enable controls and movement
handleCollisions(myCar) // Enable handling collisions with sprites
setupHealth(myCar) // Setup health bar
```
{% endcode %}
