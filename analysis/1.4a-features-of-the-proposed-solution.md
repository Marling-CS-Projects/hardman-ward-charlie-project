# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Features of the proposed solution

### Controls

For keyboard users, my game will use the WSAD keys to move about, with W to move forward, S to move backward, A to turn left, and D to turn right. The space bar will be used to jump and the shift key will be used to activate whatever weapon the player is holding.

For touchscreen users, my game will render five buttons on the left hand side of the screen upon detection of a touchscreen to move forward and backward, turn left or right, and to jump. This is how Minecraft implemented touchscreen support on smartphones and tablets. Another button on the right hand side of the screen will be used to activate weapon.

### Progressive difficulty

My game will have five levels. The terrain of the map is static but differs between levels. Enemies will be spawned across the map randomly and become more frequent, faster, and deal more damage as the player progresses through levels.&#x20;

### Account system and leaderboard

Players will have the choice to play as a guest or sign in. Should they choose the latter, their quickest time taken to beat the game will be saved in a database. The top 50 records will be displayed on the leaderboard alongside their usernames.

### Enemies

My game will consist of the following monsters, based off of those from Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons, and Terraria:

* Zombie (all)
* Skeleton (all)
* Creeper (Minecraft & Minecraft Dungeons)
* Undead Miner (Terraria)
* Iceologer (Minecraft Dungeons)
* Blastling (Minecraft Dungeons)

## Limitations

### Gamepad support

My game will be made using Kaboom.js, which at the present time lacks support for mapping gamepad keys. Therefore, it will not support gamepad controllers or be playable on games consoles such as the Xbox and PlayStation.
