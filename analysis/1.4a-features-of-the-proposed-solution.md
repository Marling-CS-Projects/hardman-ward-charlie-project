# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Overview

The game I want to make will contain graphics and monsters of Minecraft but in 2D and in the form of a graphics game. It will have five levels, each with three stages. At the end of each level, the player will fight&#x20;

### Level 1

The Overworld dimension will be the environment level 1 is set in. Monsters in level 1 include zombies, skeletons, and creepers, and the player will make their way through a forest, desert, and taiga biome. The final boss in level 1 will be a pillager outpost, which the goal is to kill all the pillagers and raid the chest of goods.

### Level 2

Level 2 retains the Overworld dimension and monsters as level 1, although there are some new additions: spiders and witches. The player will travel through a mesa and plains to get to a village, where the bad omen acquired as a result of fighting the pillagers in the outpost will trigger a raid. The player must defeat the raid and kill the illusioner, which does not spawn naturally in vanilla Minecraft. If successful, they will receive gifts from the villagers.

### Level 3

In Level 3, the player starts next to a ruined portal which they must light using the flint and steel taken from the outpost chest. The portal takes them to the Nether dimension, a hell-like world. They fight piglins and hoglins as they travel through a Crimson Forest looking for a Nether fortress. In the final round, they must fight wither skeletons in the Nether fortress before fighting the Wither boss.&#x20;

### Level 4

Level 4 retains the Nether dimension of Level 3. The player is tasked with surviving in the Nether fortress.
