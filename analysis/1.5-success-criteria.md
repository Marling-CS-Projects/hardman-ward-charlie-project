| 1        | Use WSAD keys to move/turn the player and space bar to jump.                                                         | A large portion of games played with a keyboard use these controls, so most gamers will be familiar with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls-for-movement">Controls for movement</a></li></ul><p></p> |
| 2        | Reposition the camera when the player moves so that they are always in the centre.                                   | This style of game, known as a side-scroller, is especially common in 2D platform games. The player will always see their character in the same part of the screen.                                                                                                                                                         | <p></p><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#side-scrolling">Side-scrolling</a></li></ul>               |
| 3        | When the player attempts to use a weapon, first check if they are in range of their target and provide an indicator. | The sword can only be used in close-range combat, while the bow and grenade can be thrown from maximum distances. An indicator will inform the player if they are in range of their target.                                                                                                                                 | <p></p><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons">Weapons</a></li></ul>                             |
| 4        | Enemy sprites will detect if the player is in close range and pursue them.                                           | In order to make the game more engaging, enemy sprites will continually check if the player is within 12 tiles (1 tile = 32 pixels) distance, and if so, the game will compare the player x coordinate to that of the enemy so the enemy knows which direction to chase/attack the player depending on their combat method. | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-detection">Player detection</a></li></ul>                  |
| 5        | If a melee enemy or ranged enemy's projectile collides with the player, they should take damage.                     | The player has a limited amount of health points, so a damage system will make them pay more attention to enemies in the game. The damage taken on collision will depend on the type of enemy and difficulty level.                                                                                                         | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#health-system">Health system</a></li><li>TBA</li></ul>            |
