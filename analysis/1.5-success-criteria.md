| 1        | Use WSAD keys to move/turn the player and space bar to jump.                                                         | A large portion of games played with a keyboard use these controls, so most gamers will be familiar with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls-for-movement">Controls for movement</a></li></ul><p></p> |
| 2        | Reposition the camera when the player moves so that they are always in the centre.                                   | This style of game, known as a side-scroller, is especially common in 2D platform games. The player will always see their character in the same part of the screen.                                                                                                                                                         | <p></p><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#side-scrolling">Side-scrolling</a></li></ul>               |
| 3        | When the player attempts to use a weapon, first check if they are in range of their target and provide an indicator. | The sword can only be used in close-range combat, while the bow and grenade can be thrown from maximum distances. An indicator will inform the player if they are in range of their target.                                                                                                                                 | <p></p><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons">Weapons</a></li></ul>                             |
| 4        | Enemy sprites will detect if the player is in close range and pursue them.                                           | In order to make the game more engaging, enemy sprites will continually check if the player is within 12 tiles (1 tile = 32 pixels) distance, and if so, the game will compare the player x coordinate to that of the enemy so the enemy knows which direction to chase/attack the player depending on their combat method. | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-detection">Player detection</a></li></ul>                  |
| 5        | If a melee enemy or ranged enemy's projectile collides with the player, they should take damage.                     | The player has a limited amount of health points, so a damage system will make them pay more attention to enemies in the game. The damage taken on collision will depend on the type of enemy and difficulty level.                                                                                                         | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#health-system">Health system</a></li><li>TBA</li></ul>            |

| 6        | Validate registration details to make sure the password is strong enough and the username is not already in use. | A strong password is needed to stop it from being easily guessed or cracked, and the username must be unique to distinguish the account from others.                                                                                                     |           |
| 7        | Generate a unique session ID and store it in a cookie.                                                           | Storing the username or password of the account in plaintext in a cookie is dangerous because it can easily be altered to give access to someone else's account. A random unique ID that corresponds to the username in a SQL table will be more secure. |           |
| 8        | Use bcrypt to encrypt user passwords in SQL table.                                                               | Storing a password in plaintext is bad security practice and it is recommended to use a hashing algorithm that cannot be reversed. I have decided on using the bcrypt algorithm, which has been implemented in Node.js.                                  |           |

| 9        | Distinguish between multiplayer sessions through unique codes. | When playing on a multiplayer session, any action of a player, for example movement, will be broadcast to other clients connected to that session. A unique code for each game will prevent the back-end becoming confused between sessions. | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></li></ul> |
| 10       | Transfer of power if the session host quits.                   | When a player joins a session, the time they joined at will be recorded and stored in the server. If the host quits the game while it is still waiting, the role of host will be transferred to the next player who joined earliest.         | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></li></ul> |
| 11       | Join session with unique code.                                 | Before the session host formally starts the game, up to three other players can join by entering the unique code.                                                                                                                            | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></li></ul> |
