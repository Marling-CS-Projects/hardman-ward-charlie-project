| Ref.

| 1        | Movement                  | To progress throughout the game, the player must be able to move their character. In addition, the game will constantly update the camera so that the player's character is always in the centre of the screen.           | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls-for-movement">Controls for movement</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#side-scrolling">Side-scrolling</a></li></ul> |
| 2        | Weapon activation         | The player can choose from three weapons (sword, bow, grenade) to fight enemies.                                                                                                                                          | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#hotbar">Hotbar</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons">Weapons</a></li></ul>                                             |
| 3        | Enemy detection of player | Enemies will detect players within a certain range of them and work out which direction to move to get to the player. This makes the game more engaging because the player is forced to fight enemies.                    | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-detection">Player detection</a></li></ul>                                                                                                         |
| 4        | Collision detection       | If a melee enemy (such as zombie) or projectile of ranged enemy (such as a skeleton's arrow) hits a player, they should take damage. Likewise collision with a player's weapon or projectile would do damage to an enemy. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
