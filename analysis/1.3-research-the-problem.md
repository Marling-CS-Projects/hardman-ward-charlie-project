### Overview

Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang [(Coldewey, 2011)](https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/15/a-brief-explanation-of-why-minecraft-matters/). Players can mine blocks and build with them, and use the items they gather as "ingredients" to craft other items for game progression. There are two game modes: creative and survival. In survival, players must gather their own resources and food whilst fighting monsters. This is in contrast to creative, players are given infinite resources and do not have to eat to survive [(Washington Post, 2013)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/what-is-minecraft/2013/03/14/98c54514-8a57-11e2-a051-6810d606108d\_story.html). Minecraft has been released on PC, Mac [(Minecraft.net, 2022)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc), Xbox 360/One/Series X, Playstation 3/4/5 [(Attack of the Fanboy, 2013)](https://attackofthefanboy.com/news/4j-studios-confirmed-handling-minecraft-ps4/), Wii U [(Craddock, 2018)](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/minecraft\_wii\_u\_edition\_gets\_its\_last\_ever\_update\_developer\_4j\_reminisces\_over\_last\_gen\_consoles), Nintendo 3DS [(Minecraft.net, 2019)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-nintendo-3ds-update), Android, iOS [(Schramm, 2011)](https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-16-minecraft-pocket-edition-out-on-ios-today.html), Windows Phone [(Davies, 2017)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/upgrade-windows-phone-players), and Raspberry Pi [(Upton, 2014)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/using-minecraft-raspberry-pi-edition-to-get-kids-computing/).

### Common monsters

#### Zombie

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Zombie_JE3_BE2.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Zombies are monsters in Minecraft that only spawn in the dark and attack the player close-up. They have 10 hearts, inflict a low amount of damage on the player, and will burn when exposed to daylight [(DigMinecraft, 2015)](https://www.digminecraft.com/mobs/zombie.php). On death, a zombie will drop up to 2 rotten flesh [(GameGuide, 2012)](https://www.game.guide/minecraft-zombies).&#x20;

#### Skeleton

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Lefthandedskeleton.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Skeletons are monsters that fire arrows with a bow at the player. Like zombies, they only spawn in the dark and burn in daylight [(Thakur, 2022)](https://www.wepc.com/gaming/minecraft/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-minecraft-skeleton/). Upon death, skeletons can drop up to 2 bones and arrows, and there is a small chance of it dropping any of its gear such as its bow or helmet [(IGN, n.d.)](https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Skeleton).

#### Creeper

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Creeper.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Creepers originated from a failed attempt to implement the pig, after Minecraft creator Notch mixed up the height and length values [(Hillier, 2014)](https://www.vg247.com/minecraft-creepers-happy-birthday). They will silently move towards the player, giving only a short hiss before they explode, dealing a great amount of damage, sometimes killing the player, along with destroying blocks close to the explosion [(Brown, 2021)](https://screenrant.com/minecraft-creeper-origin-design-how-avoid-mob-attack/).

#### Enderman

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Enderman.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Endermen spawn in all three dimensions: The Overworld, the Nether, and the End [(Geere, 2021)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/around-block--warped-forest). They are neutral towards the player, meaning they only attack upon being provoked — in the Enderman's case, this means when the player either attacks it or looks directly at it [(wikiHow, 2021)](https://www.wikihow.com/Avoid-an-Enderman-Attack-in-Minecraft). They attack by teleporting towards the player and trying to hit them [(DigMinecraft, 2015)](https://www.digminecraft.com/mobs/enderman.php). Endermen have 20 hearts and sometimes drop Ender Pearls which can be used by the player to teleport a certain range.

### Health and hunger bars

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Health bar

The health bar displays how much damage the player is able to take before dying. It is split into 10 hearts, each representing 2 health points [(Burkett, 2022)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/minecraft-s-health-hunger-bars-explained). Health can be replenished with a full or near-full hunger bar or through certain positive status effects [(Maillot, 2022)](https://gamerant.com/minecraft-every-status-effect-how-to-get-them/).

#### Hunger bar

The hunger bar is split into 10 drumsticks, each representing 2 hunger points. The player can regenerate health when the hunger the hunger bar is at 9 drumsticks (18 points) or more [(Burkett, 2022)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/minecraft-s-health-hunger-bars-explained). The bar depletes as the player performs certain activities in the game such as sprinting. It can be replenished by eating food. Depending on the difficulty, running out of hunger can be fatal [(Maillot, 2022)](https://gamerant.com/minecraft-how-hunger-works/).

### Difficulty

Minecraft has four difficulty modes: peaceful, easy, normal, and hard [(Apex Hosting, 2021)](https://apexminecrafthosting.com/how-to-set-difficulty-in-minecraft-server/). Difficulty affects the frequency of monsters spawning, the damage they inflict on the player, and their behaviour [(Whitworth, 2022)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/all-difficulty-levels-minecraft). For example, on Easy difficulty, zombies can only inflict up 2.5 hearts of damage per hit, while on Hard, this can be up to 4.5 hearts [(IGN, n.d.)](https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Zombie). Additionally, zombies can break down doors in Hard mode [(Choudhary, 2022)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/5-things-happen-hard-difficulty-minecraft), which makes the game more challenging as they can enter player bases and village houses.

### Singleplayer and multiplayer modes

Minecraft can be played alone or with others. On the PC/Mac Edition, players can join a public server, play with others on the same network, or purchase a "Realm" hosted by Mojang [(Witman, 2022)](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-play-multiplayer-in-minecraft-java).

Some of the most well-known Minecraft servers have hundreds of thousands of players logging in every day to play, such as Hypixel [(Hays, 2022)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/10-best-minecraft-servers-play-2022).

## Terraria

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Terraria is a 2D sandbox video game developed by Re-Logic. It has many similarities with Minecraft, such as being a block-based sandbox and being themed around building and exploration [(Brown, 2021)](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-minecraft-and-terraria). However, the two games differ in various ways. Terraria has a clear sense of progression as players must expand their base, acquire better weaponry, and fight bosses. This contrasts to Minecraft, where the end goal is much more open to interpretation as the game allows players to do whatever they want [(Sepulveda, 2021)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/terraria-vs-minecraft-5-major-differences-games). Additionally, Terraria is more oriented towards adventure and combat, whereas Minecraft allows for more creative building and player control over game progression [(Zalace, 2023)](https://www.thegamer.com/terraria-vs-minecraft-which-game-is-better).

### Side-scrolling

A side-scroller is a type of video game where the camera moves in accordance to how the player is moving, so that the player sprite is always visible in a certain position on the screen [(Rouse, 2011)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27153/side-scroller). Side-scrolling is implemented in Terraria so that the player is always in the horizontal centre of the screen. This is so the player always has a good view of their surroundings.

### Hotbar

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Inventory.webp" alt=""><figcaption><p>A hotbar layout in Terraria</p></figcaption></figure>

The hotbar is a panel of up to 10 items chosen by the player that can be accessed with the number keys on the keyboard. Typically, players tend to put weapons, tools, blocks, and potions in their hotbar [(Greenfield, 2020)](https://www.gamegrin.com/articles/terraria-how-to-navigate-the-inventory-screen).

### Background walls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A player's house in Terraria that uses background walls</p></figcaption></figure>

Background walls are tiles that provide a background on top of the existing background of the biomes and protect structures from enemy invasions [(Mančinskas, n.d.)](https://www.gamespedition.com/pc-games/indie-games/indie-adventure-games/terraria/terraria-tips-tricks-strategy-guide/how-to-make-walls-in-terraria).

| Focus on adventure and combat | Adventure and combat is more exciting and engaging for the player and will ensure they won't become bored quickly                                                                                                     |
| Hotbar                        | Different weapons work best against different mobs. For example, a bow is best for dealing with creepers because they explode in close proximity of the player. A hotbar allows the player to switch between weapons. |

## Minecraft Dungeons

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Minecraft Dungeons is a dungeon-crawler video game based in the world of its sandbox predecessor, Minecraft [(Watts, 2020)](https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-dungeons-review/). The player must venture through levels to defend villagers, fight monsters, and beat the final boss of the game, the Arch-Illager [(Minecraft.net, 2021)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-dungeons). Although it is based in the world of Minecraft, there are several key differences in the style of gameplay. Minecraft Dungeons lacks the ability to build [(Jensen, 2020)](https://uk.pcmag.com/gaming-gear/127137/minecraft-dungeons-is-here-but-what-is-minecraft-without-building) and unlike the original Minecraft, which was a sandbox game with freedom to play however one wants, Minecraft Dungeons is a dungeon crawler with the goal of progressing and adventuring through multiple stages [(Greene, 2022)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/minecraft-vs-minecraft-dungeons-how-different-two-games).

### Enemies



### Final Boss (Arch-Illager)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Arch-Illager.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Arch-Illager is Minecraft Dungeon's primary antagonist and its final boss [(Maher, 2020)](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-defeat-archillager-in-minecraft-dungeons-fi/1100-6477806/). Fighting him takes place in two stages. In the first stage, the Arch-Illager throws orbs which deal significant damage to the player upon hit, as well as summon mobs such as vindicator illagers. The second stage happens when the Arch-Illager is low on health. He spawns a Redstone Golem, which puts down more mines than others encountered throughout the game [(Puleo, 2020)](https://gamerant.com/minecraft-dungeons-arch-illager/).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Redstone_Golem.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Redstone Golem is a common boss encountered in Minecraft Dungeons

### Multiplayer

Minecraft Dungeons includes multiplayer support both online and on the local network [(Irwin, 2020)](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-dungeons-multiplayer-coop-modes-explained). Players can play in groups of up to four and although Dungeons lacked support for cross-platform multiplayer when it was released, a subsequent update allowed players to play together regardless of platform differences [(Boddy, 2020)](https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-dungeons-guide-cross-play).&#x20;
