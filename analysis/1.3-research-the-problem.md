### Overview

Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang [(Coldewey, 2011)](https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/15/a-brief-explanation-of-why-minecraft-matters/). Players can mine blocks and build with them, and use the items they gather as "ingredients" to craft other items for game progression. There are two game modes: creative and survival. In survival, players must gather their own resources and food whilst fighting monsters. This is in contrast to creative, players are given infinite resources and do not have to eat to survive [(Washington Post, 2013)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/what-is-minecraft/2013/03/14/98c54514-8a57-11e2-a051-6810d606108d\_story.html). Minecraft has been released on PC, Mac [(Minecraft.net, 2022)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc), Xbox 360/One/Series X, Playstation 3/4/5 [(Attack of the Fanboy, 2013)](https://attackofthefanboy.com/news/4j-studios-confirmed-handling-minecraft-ps4/), Wii U [(Craddock, 2018)](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/minecraft\_wii\_u\_edition\_gets\_its\_last\_ever\_update\_developer\_4j\_reminisces\_over\_last\_gen\_consoles), Nintendo 3DS [(Minecraft.net, 2019)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-nintendo-3ds-update), Android, iOS [(Schramm, 2011)](https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-16-minecraft-pocket-edition-out-on-ios-today.html), Windows Phone [(Davies, 2017)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/upgrade-windows-phone-players), and Raspberry Pi [(Upton, 2014)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/using-minecraft-raspberry-pi-edition-to-get-kids-computing/).

### Singleplayer and multiplayer modes

Minecraft can be played alone or with others. On the PC/Mac Edition, players can join a public server, play with others on the same network, or purchase a "Realm" hosted by Mojang [(Witman, 2022)](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-play-multiplayer-in-minecraft-java).

Some of the most well-known Minecraft servers have hundreds of thousands of players logging in every day to play, such as Hypixel [(Hays, 2022)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/10-best-minecraft-servers-play-2022).

| Well-known Minecraft monsters and bosses                                                      | People who have already played Minecraft will be familiar with these characters.                                                                              |
| A few monsters and bosses that were "cancelled" by the developers or exist in well-known mods | There aren't enough bosses in vanilla Minecraft for five levels of a platform game, so I'll put in some monsters from mods and that lost the annual mob vote. |
| Multiplayer                                                                                   | A lot of my problem identification is based on loneliness and how video games solve that, so I will let players work together in groups of up to 4.           |
