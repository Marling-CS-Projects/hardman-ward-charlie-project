### Overview

Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang [(Coldewey, 2011)](https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/15/a-brief-explanation-of-why-minecraft-matters/). Players can mine blocks and build with them, and use the items they gather as "ingredients" to craft other items for game progression. There are two game modes: creative and survival. In survival, players must gather their own resources and food whilst fighting monsters. This is in contrast to creative, players are given infinite resources and do not have to eat to survive [(Washington Post, 2013)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/what-is-minecraft/2013/03/14/98c54514-8a57-11e2-a051-6810d606108d\_story.html). Minecraft has been released on PC, Mac [(Minecraft.net, 2022)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc), Xbox 360/One/Series X, Playstation 3/4/5 [(Attack of the Fanboy, 2013)](https://attackofthefanboy.com/news/4j-studios-confirmed-handling-minecraft-ps4/), Wii U [(Craddock, 2018)](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/minecraft\_wii\_u\_edition\_gets\_its\_last\_ever\_update\_developer\_4j\_reminisces\_over\_last\_gen\_consoles), Nintendo 3DS [(Minecraft.net, 2019)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-nintendo-3ds-update), Android, iOS [(Schramm, 2011)](https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-16-minecraft-pocket-edition-out-on-ios-today.html), Windows Phone [(Davies, 2017)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/upgrade-windows-phone-players), and Raspberry Pi [(Upton, 2014)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/using-minecraft-raspberry-pi-edition-to-get-kids-computing/).

### Singleplayer and multiplayer modes

Minecraft can be played alone or with others. On the PC/Mac Edition, players can join a public server, play with others on the same network, or purchase a "Realm" hosted by Mojang [(Witman, 2022)](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-play-multiplayer-in-minecraft-java).

Some of the most well-known Minecraft servers have hundreds of thousands of players logging in every day to play, such as Hypixel [(Hays, 2022)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/10-best-minecraft-servers-play-2022).

## Terraria

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Terraria is a 2D sandbox video game developed by Re-Logic. It has many similarities with Minecraft, such as being a block-based sandbox and being themed around building and exploration [(Brown, 2021)](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-minecraft-and-terraria). However, the two games differ in various ways. Terraria has a clear sense of progression as players must expand their base, acquire better weaponry, and fight bosses. This contrasts to Minecraft, where the end goal is much more open to interpretation as the game allows players to do whatever they want [(Sepulveda, 2021)](https://www.sportskeeda.com/minecraft/terraria-vs-minecraft-5-major-differences-games). Additionally, Terraria is more oriented towards adventure and combat, whereas Minecraft allows for more creative building and player control over game progression [(Zalace, 2023)](https://www.thegamer.com/terraria-vs-minecraft-which-game-is-better).
