# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction means the removal of unnecessary information in a problem to focus only on the important information. It is useful in programming because it helps avoid overcomplicating the solution and allows the developer to focus on the high-level design of the program.

My game will use abstraction in the following ways:

* Graphics: While I would like to make detailed graphics, I will start with basic graphics so I can focus on programming. If I still have time after completing my game, I will improve the graphics.
* Leaderboard + Login: Although the game itself will be written in Kaboom.js, these sections will be separate HTML pages. I won't add CSS to make the page look tidier and more professional until I've finished development, just in case I don't have enough time.
* Enemy detection of player: When a player comes within specified range of an enemy, my game will compare the player x coordinate to that enemy's x coordinate to determine which direction the enemy will move in to pursue the player. This algorithm is easy to implement and improves the intelligence of enemies in tracking their targets.

## Thinking Ahead



## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable problems. It is useful because it simplifies development of the solution and makes it easier to apply changes. I will focus on one section of my game at a time and finish a section before starting on another. Since my game will be full-stack, I will develop the back-end first so when I start development of the front-end I can test features reliant on the back-end such as multiplayer and the leaderboard. Additionally, I will bundle interactive elements of my game such as movement into functions because each interactive element will have two listeners for touch and keyboard input; calling functions would simplify the code.
