## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction means the removal of unnecessary information in a problem to focus only on the important information. It is useful in programming because it helps avoid overcomplicating the solution and allows the developer to focus on the high-level design of the program.

My game will use abstraction in the following ways:

* Graphics: While I would like to make detailed graphics, I will start with basic graphics so I can focus on programming. If I still have time after completing my game, I will improve the graphics.
* Leaderboard + Login: Although the game itself will be written in Kaboom.js, these sections will be separate HTML pages. I won't add CSS to make the page look tidier and more professional until I've finished development, just in case I don't have enough time.
* Enemy detection of player: When a player comes within specified range of an enemy, my game will compare the player x coordinate to that enemy's x coordinate to determine which direction the enemy will move in to pursue the player. This algorithm is easy to implement and improves the intelligence of enemies in tracking their targets.

## Thinking Ahead



## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable problems. It is useful because it simplifies development of the solution and makes it easier to apply changes.

My game will use decomposition in the following ways:

* Multiplayer: The multiplayer aspect of my game will be split into three modules: hosting of each game, distinguishing between different games, and communication between clients. This will simplify development of multiplayer and allow me to focus on a specific area if problems arise.

## Thinking Concurrently
