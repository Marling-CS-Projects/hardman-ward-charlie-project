# 2.2.2 Cycle 2: Login/registration pages

## Design

In this second cycle, I will be writing the HTML pages for user login and registration, making use of the form element. I will later be connecting this with my back-end to facilitate registration of new accounts and authentication of existing accounts using sqlite3 for storing and bcrypt for hashing passwords so they can be stored securely.

### Objectives

* [ ] Write HTML login page with username and password fields
* [ ] Write HTML registration page with username, email, and password fields
* [ ] Test form submission
