# 2.2.1 Cycle 1: Login system

## Design

In the first cycle, I will be developing the back-end aspects of the login system using Node.js, SQLite, and the bcrypt hashing algorithm, before writing the HTML pages for login and registration that will be displayed to the user.

The aim is to allow new players to create an account with the password stored securely in a SQLite database table, and existing players to securely authenticate and have the browser store a cookie so the game can tell if signed in.

### Objectives

* [ ] Create a Node.js project in Visual Studio Code
* [ ] Install SQLite3, Express.js, and bcrypt modules using NPM
* [ ] Write functions to register a new account or authenticate an existing one
* [ ] Validate the details provided by the user
* [ ] Handle errors that occur during login/registration
* [ ] Handle POST requests from the client to login and register
* [ ] Write an HTML webpage containing login and registration forms that send POST requests on submission
