### Criterion 1 and 2

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/jGz4ymYn4xE" %}

I implemented the controls for the game using key press events, which continually check for specific keys to be held down and then perform a certain action. My game uses the WSAD keys to move the car forward and in reverse, and to turn the car left and right. Changes in movement are broadcasted to other players in the room in real time to ensure a multiplayer experience.

Whenever the player's car changes, the camera position is updated so the car stays at the same vertical position on the screen and the road is always centred. This means the player has a clear view of what is in front of them as well as what is close behind.

### Criterion 3

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/1-3mvhvs_R0" %}
Tests 1 and 2: Player picks up power-ups from chest which are displayed in the container
{% endembed %}

I added a collision handler to detect whenever a player collides with a chest, if this happens the client sends an event to other clients in the room with the chest's position. The other clients' game deletes the block corresponding to that position from the world, resulting in it disappearing as the game continually destroys and re-renders all blocks in the camera view.

The game takes into account the player's position in the race and their health when determining what power-up to give them. If they have low health, then they are more likely to get a healing or regeneration potion; while if they are not first place, they are more likely to get a speed potion. This  aims to be helpful to players who are far behind or at low health and at risk of dying.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/uIn6H6TlQx0" %}

If the player activates a fireball power-up, they can click wherever they want on their screen to shoot the fireball. I decided to implement shooting this way as it gives the player more control and precision over their target, most likely another car. Once they click to shoot, the fireball travels in the direction of where the player clicked by using trigonometric functions to calculate how much it needs to move in terms of X and Y. A collision handler is used to detect if the fireball hits a car. If it does, it explodes, inflicting four points of damage on any player caught in the explosion.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/9Qw36g4NilM" %}

The TNT power-up is more deadly than the fireball power-up. When activated, a block of TNT is thrown behind the player. If it collides with another player it explodes, otherwise it explodes itself after three seconds. Any player caught in the explosion loses 8 health points.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/Bq8VVtD-KxE" %}

On activation of the blindness power-up, the game broadcasts an event to all other clients in the room which on receiving the event, their games cover the screen in black for a few seconds before gradually fading out until gone.

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The number of health points the player has are each represented by a red heart in the top left of the screen. Any health points the player has lost are represented by grey hearts. The aim of the health system is to provide an incentive for the player not to get injured as if they run out of health points they die and are unable to move for a period of time. Additionally, it is important for a game with a health system for the player to be able to see how much health they have left.

### Criterion 5

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/xcqqm5Fv0kk" %}
Potion of speed
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/CsaDTIVA0oU" %}
Potion of healing
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/wRb0cY3IPR4" %}
Potion of regeneration
{% endembed %}

There are three potion power-ups in my game: speed, healing, and regeneration. The purpose of these is to help the player in situations where they are behind other players or are at low health and therefore at increased risk of dying. Speed increases the maximum speed for 10 seconds, regeneration restores 1 health a second for 10 seconds, and healing instantly restores 3 health. All three of these power-ups work as expected.

### Criterion 7

Collision detection does not have a cycle or evidence of its own, as it falls into several of the other criteria. Detection of the car colliding with chests, projectiles, and explosions are shown to work in criterion 3 and collision with monsters in criterion 6.

### Criterion 8

Similarly to criterion 7, broadcasting updates to rooms spans a wide range of criterion, for example broadcasting movement in criterion 1 and showing projectiles such as fireballs in criterion 3. In all cases it has been shown to work correctly.&#x20;

### Criterion 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (83).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Registering a new account was relatively straightforward and successful, writing an entry to the users table of the database with the given username and password. This is important for my game as players must be signed in to play and registration allows those who have not played before to create an account.

### Criterion 10

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/j5-FgtgZ_5w" %}

Logging into an existing account with the right credentials was successful, resulting in the player being able to see the title screen and access options for multiplayer. This is important like registration as players must be signed in to play.

### Criterion 11

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/Yon0XRv4_-w" %}

Attempting to register a username already in use resulted in an error being displayed, which is how I intended. This is important because allowing multiple of the same username to be registered could result in the server becoming confused when the player tries to sign in as the accounts will have different passwords. It will also result in confusion when joining a room and starting the game as there could be multiple of the same username.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/dInTd0hl6B0" %}

Attempting to sign in with the incorrect username or password results in an error being displayed, which is how I intended. The reason for this is security and protection of identity; without a way to verify the password is correct, someone could pretend to be another user. This could especially be bad if in the future I wanted to add a chat feature or collect more information from the user like their email address.

### Criterion 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Forms are a user-friendly way of collecting information through HTML and JavaScript hence why I decided to use them for login and registration. Both the login and registration form are easily accessible and do as intended.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Whether the forms were user friendly was checked in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), where all 11 respondents  said yes.
