### Criteria

| Criterion | Description               | When was it achieved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Criterion 1 and 2

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/jGz4ymYn4xE" %}

I implemented the controls for the game using key press events, which continually check for specific keys to be held down and then perform a certain action. My game uses the WSAD keys to move the car forward and in reverse, and to turn the car left and right. Changes in movement are broadcasted to other players in the room in real time to ensure a multiplayer experience.

Whenever the player's car changes, the camera position is updated so the car stays at the same vertical position on the screen and the road is always centred. This means the player has a clear view of what is in front of them as well as what is close behind.

### Criterion 3

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/1-3mvhvs_R0" %}
Tests 1 and 2: Player picks up power-ups from chest which are displayed in the container
{% endembed %}

I added a collision handler to detect whenever a player collides with a chest, if this happens the client sends an event to other clients in the room with the chest's position. The other clients' game deletes the block corresponding to that position from the world, resulting in it disappearing as the game continually destroys and re-renders all blocks in the camera view.

The game takes into account the player's position in the race and their health when determining what power-up to give them. If they have low health, then they are more likely to get a healing or regeneration potion; while if they are not first place, they are more likely to get a speed potion. This  aims to be helpful to players who are far behind or at low health and at risk of dying.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/uIn6H6TlQx0" %}

If the player activates a fireball power-up, they can click wherever they want on their screen to shoot the fireball. I decided to implement shooting this way as it gives the player more control and precision over their target, most likely another car. Once they click to shoot, the fireball travels in the direction of where the player clicked by using trigonometric functions to calculate how much it needs to move in terms of X and Y. A collision handler is used to detect if the fireball hits a car. If it does, it explodes, inflicting four points of damage on any player caught in the explosion.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/9Qw36g4NilM" %}

The TNT power-up is more deadly than the fireball power-up. When activated, a block of TNT is thrown behind the player. If it collides with another player it explodes, otherwise it explodes itself after three seconds. Any player caught in the explosion loses 8 health points.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/Bq8VVtD-KxE" %}

On activation of the blindness power-up, the game broadcasts an event to all other clients in the room which on receiving the event, their games cover the screen in black for a few seconds before gradually fading out until gone.

### Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The number of health points the player has are each represented by a red heart in the top left of the screen. Any health points the player has lost are represented by grey hearts. The aim of the health system is to provide an incentive for the player not to get injured as if they run out of health points they die and are unable to move for a period of time. Additionally, it is important for a game with a health system for the player to be able to see how much health they have left.

### Criterion 5

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/xcqqm5Fv0kk" %}
Potion of speed
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/CsaDTIVA0oU" %}
Potion of healing
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/wRb0cY3IPR4" %}
Potion of regeneration
{% endembed %}

There are three potion power-ups in my game: speed, healing, and regeneration. The purpose of these is to help the player in situations where they are behind other players or are at low health and therefore at increased risk of dying. Speed increases the maximum speed for 10 seconds, regeneration restores 1 health a second for 10 seconds, and healing instantly restores 3 health. All three of these power-ups work as expected.

### Criterion 7

Collision detection does not have a cycle or evidence of its own, as it falls into several of the other criteria. Detection of the car colliding with chests, projectiles, and explosions are shown to work in criterion 3 and collision with monsters in criterion 6.

### Criterion 8

Similarly to criterion 7, broadcasting updates to rooms spans a wide range of criterion, for example broadcasting movement in criterion 1 and showing projectiles such as fireballs in criterion 3. In all cases it has been shown to work correctly.&#x20;

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description  | When was it achieved                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9         | Registration | [Cycle 2](../2-design-and-development/2.2.2-cycle-2.md)                                                          |
| 10        | Login        | [Cycle 3](../2-design-and-development/2.2.3-cycle-3.md)                                                          |
| 11        | Validation   | [Cycle 2](../2-design-and-development/2.2.2-cycle-2.md), [Cycle 3](../2-design-and-development/2.2.3-cycle-3.md) |
| 12        | Forms        | [Cycle 2](../2-design-and-development/2.2.2-cycle-2.md)                                                          |

### Criterion 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (83).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Registering a new account was relatively straightforward and successful, writing an entry to the users table of the database with the given username and password. This is important for my game as players must be signed in to play and registration allows those who have not played before to create an account.

### Criterion 10

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/j5-FgtgZ_5w" %}

Logging into an existing account with the right credentials was successful, resulting in the player being able to see the title screen and access options for multiplayer. This is important like registration as players must be signed in to play.

### Criterion 11

The purpose of this criterion is to allow the server to handle invalid information being submitted in the login and registration forms. In my case, this is usernames already in use for registration and incorrect credentials for login.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/Yon0XRv4_-w" %}

Attempting to register a username already in use resulted in an error being displayed, which is how I intended. This is important because allowing multiple of the same username to be registered could result in the server becoming confused when the player tries to sign in as the accounts will have different passwords. It will also result in confusion when joining a room and starting the game as there could be multiple of the same username.

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/dInTd0hl6B0" %}

Attempting to sign in with the incorrect username or password results in an error being displayed, which is how I intended. The reason for this is security and protection of identity; without a way to verify the password is correct, someone could pretend to be another user. This could especially be bad if in the future I wanted to add a chat feature or collect more information from the user like their email address.

### Criterion 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Forms are a user-friendly way of collecting information through HTML and JavaScript hence why I decided to use them for login and registration. Both the login and registration form are easily accessible and do as intended.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Whether the forms were user friendly was checked in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), where all 11 respondents said yes.

## User interface

| Criterion | Description        | When was it achieved                                       |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

| 19        | Leaderboard        | [Cycle 21](../2-design-and-development/2.2.21-cycle-21.md) |
| 20        | Final leaderboard  | [Cycle 22](../2-design-and-development/2.2.22-cycle-22.md) |

### Criterion 13

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The title screen displays to signed in users with the options to play the game and sign out, and the player's username. The purpose of this criterion is to provide a starting screen to the player that is clear about what they need to do to play the game.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (71).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

However when players were asked how clear the title screen was in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), the responses were mixed. Although nearly three quarters agreed it was at least "mostly clear", over a quarter said it was somewhat unclear or not clear at all. This suggests I could have made the title screen more clear about what the player needed to do.

### Criterion 14

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Since my game requires players to be signed in to play, it must be prepared for a player to load the game not signed in and what action to take. The purpose of the login info screen is to briefly explain to the player they must be signed in, along with a button that takes them to the form page to login or register an account. The login info scene is shown when expected, and clicking on the sign in button takes the player to the form page.

### Criterion 15 and 16

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/DzuUlsNumSU" %}

The purpose of criterion 15 is to provide a screen that allows the player to join an existing room by entering an eight character code or create a new room. The scene and all its functions work as intended. In [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), all respondents agreed the game was at least mostly clear about options for multiplayer, with over half saying it was very clear.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (72).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The aim of criterion 16 is to provide a screen that appears after creating or joining a room that shows the room code, a constantly-updated list of members, and a button that starts the game. This is important because the player needs to know the room code if they wish to invite others, they probably would want to know who has joined their room, and they need a way to start the game once they have got all the desired people to join. This screen appears in the video after creating or joining the room, and performs all its functions as intended.

### Criterion 17

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The aim of this criterion is to represent the player's health points by hearts. This is important for a game with a health system so the player knows how much health they have because they die if they run out of health, and may wish to act more cautiously if they have a low number. The health bar shows in the top left of the screen as intended and shows the number of health the player has through red hearts.

### Criterion 18

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As my game has a wide variety of power-ups to help the player and hinder their opponents, it is useful for the player to know what power-up they currently have if they do have one. The purpose of this criterion is to display a small icon that hints at what the power-up does, such as a crossed out eye for blindness. After the player receives a power-up from a chest, the corresponding icon to the power-up is displayed in a container in the left of the screen; therefore this criterion works as intended.

### Criterion 19

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/e0ugaWlEv1A" %}

The purpose of this criterion is to keep the players informed about their progress and how well they did in each level. As my game is competitive, the main aim of the player is to come first in the race. The leaderboard lists the players in order of position for that race and how many points will be added to their total which will determine the overall winner. The leaderboard shows as expected after all players have finished the level and moves onto the next after 5 seconds, giving the player enough time to see how they did.

### Criterion 20

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/AIiL1ACkANk" %}

The purpose of this criterion is to show the overall rankings of the players after completing level 4, based on a total of points acquired at the end of each level. This is important because a player's performance in one race may not be telling of their performance overall and therefore it helps for the players to see how well they did taking into account their whole performance. The final leaderboard shows as expected after the leaderboard at the end of level 4, and uses the players' total score to determine their overall positions. It also gives the player an option to go back to the title screen, which is important as I want the player to be able to play the game again if they want.

### Criterion 21 and 23

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/WvXQI8ItIak" %}

The purpose of criterion 21 was to be able to quickly generate worlds on creation of a new room being able to custom specify the block of the road (e.g. dirt), the surroundings (e.g. grass), the prop (e.g. trees), and chests. This was achieved in [Cycle 8](../2-design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8.md), where I created a function taking in these blocks as parameters that is ran four times with different parameters on creating a new room.

The purpose of criterion 23 was for the game to render enough of the world to take up the entire screen, but not too much that would result in significant lag. This works by checking the camera position and calculating the furthest X and Y co-ordinates that can be rendered, and then rendering only the blocks that fit within these co-ordinates.&#x20;

### Criterion 22

The purpose of this criterion was to provide four levels in different environments that were engaging for the player. This was achieved by generating the worlds as soon as the room was created, four times specifying different blocks and props for each level. I could not add cups similar to Mario Kart Wii as I did not have enough time to create a menu allowing players to choose their cup and lacked ideas for environments beyond the four levels I made.

### Criterion 24

When the player collides with a chest, the chest should disappear not just for that player, but other players in the room too. Theis was achieved in [Cycle 15](../2-design-and-development/2.2.14-cycle-15.md) after problems relating to lag were resolved by fixing a bug where the server would attempt to delete the same chest multiple times.

### Criterion 25

The purpose of criterion 25 is to make sure my game adheres to the PEGI 7 rating and does not include content that could be considered unsuitable for ages 7 and up. This was checked in usability testing; over 90% agreed it did follow PEGI 7.

### Criterion 26

The purpose of this criterion is to ensure the game runs smoothly so it is playable and a good experience. I tested for this in [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md), where I found the game ran more slowly on older hardware and when ran in Firefox.&#x20;

Testers gave a variety of responses when asked about the performance of the game in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md). While none reported it to be unplayable, over a quarter reported frequent lag.&#x20;

### Criterion 27

The aim of this criterion is to make the forms for login and registering an account aesthetically pleasing to the player. This makes the game as a whole look more professional and makes the process for signing in clear. In [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), when players were asked if they were impressed by the styling of the forms, nearly three quarters said yes and none said no, which is a good result.

### Criterion 28 - Not developed

In [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md), I did not encounter any instances of the server crashing. However, when other players were asked in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), almost all of them reported that the server did crash as indicated by a Cloudflare error when attempting to access the domain. This is a bad result as the multiplayer aspect of my game is dependent on the server being able to transmit data between clients.

### Criterion 29 -  Partially developed

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/b6K_JvS1EZg" %}

In the case a player abruptly disconnects from the room, I intended for their username to be removed from the waiting list if they are waiting to start, or if gameplay is already in session their car should have been removed and they are removed from the leaderboard. However, this criterion was only partially met in [Cycle 23](../2-design-and-development/2.2.23-cycle-23.md); if a player disconnects while in the waiting room their username is removed from the list, however during gameplay itself nothing happens if the player disconnects.&#x20;

This could lead to problems if a player disconnects during gameplay as the room cannot progress onto the next level until all players have completed the current level, which would force the remaining players to start again from the beginning to be able to further play. This can be especially inconvenient if one or more of the players has a poor internet connection that could lead to them unintentionally disconnecting from the game.
