### Criterion 1 and 2

I implemented the controls for the game using key press events, which continually check for specific keys to be held down and then perform a certain action. My game uses the WSAD keys to move the car forward and in reverse, and to turn the car left and right. Changes in movement are broadcasted to other players in the room in real time to ensure a multiplayer experience.

Whenever the player's car changes, the camera position is updated so the car stays at the same vertical position on the screen and the road is always centred. This means the player has a clear view of what is in front of them as well as what is close behind.

### Criterion 3

Tests 1 and 2: Player picks up power-ups from chest which are displayed in the container
{% endembed %}

I added a collision handler to detect whenever a player collides with a chest, if this happens the client sends an event to other clients in the room with the chest's position. The other clients' game deletes the block corresponding to that position from the world, resulting in it disappearing as the game continually destroys and re-renders all blocks in the camera view.

The game takes into account the player's position in the race and their health when determining what power-up to give them. If they have low health, then they are more likely to get a healing or regeneration potion; while if they are not first place, they are more likely to get a speed potion. This  aims to be helpful to players who are far behind or at low health and at risk of dying.

If the player activates a fireball power-up, they can click wherever they want on their screen to shoot the fireball. I decided to implement shooting this way as it gives the player more control and precision over their target, most likely another car. Once they click to shoot, the fireball travels in the direction of where the player clicked by using trigonometric functions to calculate how much it needs to move in terms of X and Y. A collision handler is used to detect if the fireball hits a car. If it does, it explodes, inflicting four points of damage on any player caught in the explosion.

The TNT power-up is more deadly than the fireball power-up. When activated, a block of TNT is thrown behind the player. If it collides with another player it explodes, otherwise it explodes itself after three seconds. Any player caught in the explosion loses 8 health points.

On activation of the blindness power-up, the game broadcasts an event to all other clients in the room which on receiving the event, their games cover the screen in black for a few seconds before gradually fading out until gone.

### Criterion 4

The number of health points the player has are each represented by a red heart in the top left of the screen. Any health points the player has lost are represented by grey hearts. The aim of the health system is to provide an incentive for the player not to get injured as if they run out of health points they die and are unable to move for a period of time. Additionally, it is important for a game with a health system for the player to be able to see how much health they have left.
