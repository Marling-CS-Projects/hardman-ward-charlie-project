# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Add combat power-ups that are effective in distracting other players.                      | Success      |
| 2           | Implement a smooth transition between different levels so the players can progress.        | Fail         |
| 3           | Make the options for joining an existing room or creating a new one for multiplayer clear. | Success      |

### Feature 1

Combat power-ups are power-ups that can be used against other players to hinder their performance. These are intended to distract other players and allow the user to get ahead or extend their lead. The following power-ups are combat:

* Fireball
* TNT
* Blindness
* Monster Army

All these power-ups either deal damage to other players or temporarily inconvenience them, therefore this criterion was met. In the case of the Monster Army, a majority of players asked in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md) said it was effective in distracting other players.

### Feature 2

As my game has four levels, it is important after the players in a room complete one they can easily move onto the next. I intended for the process to be automatic after briefly showing the leaderboard for that individual level. However, in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), the responses to the question of whether the transition was seamless were mixed, with over half giving it a rating of 1 or 2; therefore I consider this a fail.

I think I could have made the transition more seamless by letting players who had finished know that they were waiting for players to finish before moving on. I also think the five seconds was a little too short for players to see how they ranked and how many points they gained compared to their opponents.

### Feature 3

My game is a multiplayer game so obviously it is important to be clear to players about how to create a new room or join an existing one. In my game, after clicking play the game goes to the multiplayer scene which allows the player to enter a code to join a room or create a new one. It also includes text telling the player what to do.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                             | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Implement power-ups that assist the player in getting ahead of their opponents.         | Success      |
| 2           | Implement controls that will be familiar to many players and easy to pick up.           | Fail         |
| 3           | Create the title screen to be clear about what the player needs to do in order to play. | Success      |

### Feature 1

Since my game is a competitive racing game, the player needs a way to help them get and stay ahead of their opponents, for which I decided power-ups obtained from chests. When players were asked how useful the power-ups were in [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md), a significant majority said they were "somewhat useful" or "very useful". Therefore I consider this a success.

### Feature 2

I chose to implement WSAD controls as I thought most PC gamers would be familiar with them since they are used in many games, and therefore they would be easy to pick up. However, out of 11 testers who completed my survey, 5 chose to leave criticisms of the controls. Two suggested the arrow keys would be better for moving the car than WSAD and one noted the absence of a tutorial on how to play. Therefore I see this as a fail.

### Feature 3

Knowing how to navigate the title screen is essential to be able to play the game. Testers mostly said the title screen was clear but about a quarter said it was not; while I consider this a success as the majority still said it was clear, it does show I could have made it clearer as to what the player needs to do on the title screen.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                                              | Success/Fail     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1           | Add four levels with a different environment to each other.              | Success          |
| 2           | Generate the levels each time with random placement of props and chests. | Success and Fail |
| 3           | Implement online multiplayer to let players play together.               | Success          |

### Feature 1

After all players in the room have finished a level the game moves onto the next until all levels are done, therefore I consider this to have been successful.

### Feature 2

I thought randomly placing the props and rows of chests each time the levels were generated instead of using presets would make gameplay feel unique each time. The generation of worlds was obviously successful as the worlds are subsequently rendered when the game starts and the placement of trees and chests is different every time; however, when testers who played multiple times were asked how different the worlds were, half said it was not all that different. This shows that my intention to make the worlds look unique as failed as those who played multiple times did not think the worlds looked all that different.

### Feature 3

My game supports multiplayer through the use of rooms in which data can be exchanged between clients, such as if a player moves or activates a power-up. As said previously, the game makes clear the player's options for multiplayer, which are joining an existing room or creating a new one.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                          | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game should not crash.                                           | Fail         |
| 2           | The game should not regularly lag.                                   | Success      |
| 3           | The game should not contain any bugs that damage the user experience | Fail         |

### Feature 1

When people in my class were testing my game, some reported multiple cars stuck in the same position and updates not being broadcast across clients. When players refreshed the page, a Cloudflare error page appeared saying the problem was with the host of the server, which meant the Raspberry Pi I used to host the game had crashed. This could be to do with the Raspberry Pi being a low-power machine that could not handle a lot of requests, however I'm still classing it as a fail as the game was unable to properly handle the event of the server crashing such as by informing the players.

### Feature 2

Although when I tested the game on older computers there was some lag, this was expected as the Kaboom.js game engine is fairly recent and its developers likely did not have the older hardware of these computers in mind when they wrote it. When testers were asked about it, the majority reported lag to be rare or nonexistent.

### Feature 3

This is a fail as multiple testers chose to report bugs when filling out the survey. However, most of these bugs are related to the server crashing, such as multiple cars in the same position which resulted from a loss of communication between clients after it crashed.

One bug unrelated to the crash was that players could drive outside the camera view which would lead to problems as the player will be unable to see their car and therefore struggle to get back onto the track. This is odd considering in [Cycle 23](../2-design-and-development/2.2.23-cycle-23.md) I introduced a check to make sure players did not go off the road, but this tester reports they were still able to do so.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                                      | Success/Fail     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | Use WSAD to move around as these are familiar to many players.                   | Success and Fail |
| 2           | Use HTML and CSS stylesheets to make the login/registration forms user friendly. | Success          |

### Feature 1

I chose WSAD controls as I thought they would be familiar to many PC gamers as they are used in a lot of games. This can be considered a success as the WSAD controls do work to move the player; however most testers described the controls as unclear and some provided suggestions for alternative controls, so the intention of using these controls is a failure.

### Feature 2

I wanted the forms to register and log into an account to look professional and friendly to the player as it gives a good impression of the game overall. When testers were asked if they were impressed by the styling of the forms, a majority said yes and those who didn't said they didn't know rather than no, suggesting they did not pay much attention to how the forms looked when registering and logging in.
