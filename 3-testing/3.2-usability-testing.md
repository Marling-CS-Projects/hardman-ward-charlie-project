| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Was the aim of the game clear? Was the Monster Army an effective distraction? Was the title screen clear about to do? Were your options for joining/creating a room clear? |
| 2 - Efficient      | If you could change the controls, how would you go about it? Were the power-ups obtained from chests useful?                                                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | How challenging was the game? What impact would you say the health bar has had on the challenge of the game?                                                               |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | If you encountered any other bugs, what were they? Did the server crash?                                                                                                   |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Were the login/register forms user-friendly? Were the controls of the game clear?                                                                                          |
