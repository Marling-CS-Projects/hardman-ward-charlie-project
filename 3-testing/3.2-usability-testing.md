# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Was the aim of the game clear? Was the Monster Army an effective distraction? Was the title screen clear about to do? Were your options for joining/creating a room clear? |
| 2 - Efficient      | If you could change the controls, how would you go about it? Were the power-ups obtained from chests useful?                                                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | How challenging was the game? What impact did health bar have on the challenge of the game?                                                                                |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | If you encountered any other bugs, what were they? Did the server crash?                                                                                                   |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Were the login/register forms user-friendly? Were the controls of the game clear?                                                                                          |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

## User Feedback

To obtain the best possible user feedback for my game, I organised a session in my Computer Science class where people would be sorted into groups of 4-5 to play and then asked them to fill out a form with questions relating to my success criteria.

### Effective

From the results of this question I can see that most players thought the game was at least "mostly clear", with only 9.1% thinking it was somewhat unclear and no one thinking it was not clear at all.

An overwhelming number of respondents said the monster army power-up served as at least a somewhat effective distraction to other players, or themselves if someone else in their room used it. I am happy with this result as distracting other players was the primary intention of the monster army.

While the vast majority of players thought the title screen was clear, a significant minority think it was either somewhat unclear (18.2%) or not clear at all (9.1%). This suggests I could have made the title screen clearer, for example by adding a brief explanation for new players.

Everyone thought the multiplayer screen which allows the player to join or create a room was clear, which is good.

### Efficient

Out of the five players who chose to respond to how they would change the controls, two suggested the arrow keys should be used to move the player's car instead of WSAD and two suggested the space button to activate the power-up. One player suggested a menu laying out the controls for new players, saying that it took time for them to figure out the controls which gave them a disadvantage.

Over three quarters of respondents said the power-ups obtained from chests were useful, however 9.1% said they weren't very useful and another 9.1% said they were useless. This is not the result I was hoping for as I intended the power-ups to help players catch up or extend their lead. It suggests some players did not find the power-ups particularly helpful.

### Engaging

When asked how challenging they found the game on a scale of 1 to 5, a majority of players rated the game at least a 4, with one rating it a 5. No players rated it a 1 which is good, however two players rated it a 2 and three rated it a 3. This suggests I could have added more challenging components to the game.

The results for the impact of the health bar on the challenge of the game were disappointing. Over a quarter of respondents rated it a 1, and only 4 players out of 11 rated it a 4 or a 5. This is a bad result as the purpose of the health bar was to make the game more challenging as it gave an incentive to players not to take damage.

### Error Tolerant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (77).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Four players reported bugs during their gameplay. Three of these related to the server crashing midway through testing, which meant clients could no longer transmit updates to one another. The final bug was that players could move through trees and they could drive off the map, which could result in the player losing knowledge of where their car is and facing a disadvantage.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (78).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of players reported the server crashed during their gameplay, which resulted in a Cloudflare error screen. This is likely due to the fact I hosted the game on my Raspberry Pi 4 which lacks a lot of processing power to handle so many requests at once.&#x20;

### Easy to Learn

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All players reported that the login and register forms were user-friendly, which is a good result as sign in is necessary to play and having accessible login forms makes it easy for the player to do so.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (80).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Unfortunately, an overwhelming majority of players described the controls of my game as at least "somewhat unclear" with 9.1% saying they weren't clear at all. This is bad because if the player is taking a lot of time to figure out what the controls are this can affect their progress in the levels.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:
