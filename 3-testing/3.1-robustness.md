# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

In my [Success Criteria](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md), there are five points relating to function and robustness.

| Criterion                     | Description                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8 - Broadcast updates to room | Were other players' actions broadcast and displayed on your screen (e.g. movement)?                          |
| 9 - Registration              | How easy was the process of creating an account?                                                             |
| 10 - Login                    | How easy was the process of logging in to your account?                                                      |
| 26 - Game should run smoothly | How was the performance of the game?                                                                         |
| 28 - Server should not crash  | Did the server crash? If you try to load the page again and a Cloudflare error shows, that means it crashed. |

### Criterion 8 - Broadcast updates to room

The aim of criterion 8 is to ensure whenever one player performs an action, such as movement or shooting a fireball, that it is shown to all other users in the same room. For this to work is essential for a successful online multiplayer game.

When players were asked whether other players' actions were broadcast and displayed to them, none answered "rarely" or "not at all", however the most common answer receiving 54.5% was "Occasionally", suggesting there were some cases where other players' actions were not shown or took an unnecessary length of time to be shown.

### Criterion 9 - Registration

The aim of criterion 9 is to ensure new players can successfully create an account by entering their desired username and password. This is important because my game requires users to be signed in to play, and if registration isn't working then new players are unable to create an account.

Fortunately, all players who completed the survey rated the account creation process a "5" in terms of ease.&#x20;

### Criterion 10 - Login

The aim of criterion 10 is to ensure players can sign in to their account. Like criterion 9, this is important as my game requires users to be signed in, and if they can't sign in then nobody can play the game.

Fortunately, like for registration, all players reported the login process to be a 5 in terms of ease, meaning everyone was able to login successfully after making an account.

### Criterion 26 - Game should run smoothly

The aim of criterion 26 is to ensure the game runs smoothly with minimal lag. This is important because if the game lags then it becomes unplayable.

Player responses when asked about performance were mixed. While no one described it as "unplayable", 27.3% reported frequent lag with the same percentage reporting the game ran "very smoothly with no lag". Fortunately, the remaining 45.5% of players reported the game ran "mostly smoothly with rare lag", suggesting lag was a minor issue for a majority of players.

### Criterion 28 - Server should not crash

The aim of criterion 28 is to ensure the server hosting the game does not crash in the middle of gameplay. This is important because the server is responsible for handling login, registration, joining and creating rooms, and broadcasting player actions to other clients in the same room.&#x20;

I used Cloudflare Tunnel and a Raspberry Pi to host my game on a domain I purchased for a low price. When the server has crashed, attempting to access the domain will show an error like this:

Unfortunately, over 90% of players reported that the server did crash. This is likely due to my choice of server since the Raspberry Pi 4 has very limited resources and likely could not handle so many clients playing at once.
