# 1.5 Success Criteria

## Mechanics

<table><thead><tr><th width="105">Ref. No.</th><th width="207">Criterion</th><th width="222">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Movement with WSAD</td><td>The nature of this game requires the player be able to move their car around. WSAD is used in many PC games and therefore most gamers will be familiar with them.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Side-scrolling</td><td>The player should always be able to see their car in the same part of the screen.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Power-ups</td><td>The player needs ways to replenish health, speed up, and attack other players. Chests will be randomly scattered which give a power-up depending on various factors.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Health points</td><td>The player needs an incentive to avoid taking damage. If they run out of health points, they die.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Potions</td><td>These can be used to replenish health points and temporarily increase the speed limit.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Monsters</td><td>Monsters will attack other players distracting them allowing whoever summoned them to get ahead.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Collision detection</td><td>When the player collides with an enemy, their projectile, or an explosion, they should take a specific amount of damage.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Broadcast updates to room</td><td>When a player performs an action, other players in the room should be able to see and be affected by it if possible.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Accounts system

## Levels

<table><thead><tr><th width="107">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>21</td><td>World generation</td><td>I want to randomly scatter props and chests so each play feels unique.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Four different levels</td><td>The game should be engaging and take the players time to finish. Each level should be set in a different environment.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>World rendering</td><td>Only blocks visible in the camera view should be rendered to prevent lag.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Delete chests on collision</td><td>When a player collides with a chest, that chest should be deleted from the world so it cannot be reused.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
