# 1.5 Success Criteria

## Mechanics

<table><thead><tr><th width="105">Ref. No.</th><th width="207">Criterion</th><th width="222">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Use WSAD keys to move/turn the player and space bar to jump.</td><td>A large portion of games played with a keyboard use these controls, so most gamers will be familiar with them.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls-for-movement">Controls for movement</a></li></ul><p></p></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Reposition the camera when the player moves so that they are always in the centre.</td><td>This style of game, known as a side-scroller, is especially common in 2D platform games. The player will always see their character in the same part of the screen.</td><td><p></p><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#side-scrolling">Side-scrolling</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>When the player attempts to use a weapon, first check if they are in range of their target and provide an indicator.</td><td>The sword can only be used in close-range combat, while the bow and grenade can be thrown from maximum distances. An indicator will inform the player if they are in range of their target.</td><td><p></p><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons">Weapons</a></li></ul><p></p></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Enemies should take damage on being hit by player weapons.</td><td>The player must be able to defend themselves from enemies so in my game, they will have three choices of weapon: sword, bow, and grenade. These weapons will do varying amounts of damage.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons">Weapons</a></li></ul><p></p></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>After using a ranged weapon, the player will have to wait a certain amount of seconds before being able to use it again.</td><td>This makes the game more challenging for the player since they must be more careful in choosing when to use their ranged weapons.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#weapons">Weapons</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Enemy sprites will detect if the player is in close range and pursue them.</td><td>In order to make the game more engaging, enemy sprites will continually check if the player is within 12 tiles (1 tile = 32 pixels) distance, and if so, the game will compare the player x coordinate to that of the enemy so the enemy knows which direction to chase/attack the player depending on their combat method.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-detection">Player detection</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>If a melee enemy or ranged enemy's projectile collides with the player, they should take damage.</td><td>The player has a limited amount of health points, so a damage system will make them pay more attention to enemies in the game. The damage taken on collision will depend on the type of enemy and difficulty level.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#health-system">Health system</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>The player can pick up potions randomly scattered across the map.</td><td>Potions will give the player the edge in the final boss battle, and their effects include instant healing and strength. The potion should be placed in the furthest left slot of the hotbar that is empty.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#potions">Potions</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#hotbar">Hotbar</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Potions give the player special effects on use.</td><td>These effects will help the player in the final boss battle. </td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#potions">Potions</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Progressive difficulty</td><td>Enemy spawn frequency and damage they inflict on the player should increase as the player levels up to make the game more challenging. </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Accounts system

<table><thead><tr><th width="109">Ref. No.</th><th width="208">Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>11</td><td>Validate registration details to make sure the password is strong enough and the username is not already in use.</td><td>A strong password is needed to stop it from being easily guessed or cracked, and the username must be unique to distinguish the account from others.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Store unique numeric ID in cookie.</td><td>SQL databases allow for a unique, numeric ID known as a "primary key" to be automatically generated when adding a new entry. This will be stored in a cookie after the player logs in to identify them.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Use bcrypt to encrypt user passwords in SQL table.</td><td>Storing a password in plaintext is bad security practice and it is recommended to use a hashing algorithm that cannot be reversed. I have decided on using the bcrypt algorithm, which has been implemented in Node.js.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#bcrypt">bcrypt</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Multiplayer

<table><thead><tr><th width="107">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>14</td><td>Distinguish between multiplayer sessions through unique codes.</td><td>When playing on a multiplayer session, any action of a player, for example movement, will be broadcast to other clients connected to that session. A unique code for each game will prevent the back-end becoming confused between sessions.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Transfer of power if the session host quits.</td><td>When a player joins a session, the time they joined at will be recorded and stored in the server. If the host quits the game while it is still waiting, the role of host will be transferred to the next player who joined earliest.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Join session with unique code.</td><td>Before the session host formally starts the game, up to three other players can join by entering the unique code.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Leaderboard

<table><thead><tr><th width="107">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>17</td><td>Check the time taken to finish the game and compare it to the player's current record.</td><td>The game must first determine if the player's time taken is less than their current record before updating it in the database.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#leaderboard">Leaderboard</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Obtain top 50 time records and their correspondent usernames from the leaderboard.</td><td>It would take too much time to allow the player to navigate through the leaderboard beyond a certain amount of entries, and 50 seems like a reasonable amount. Additionally, the record and position of the player logged in should be displayed at the top of the screen so they can see it even if they are not in the top 50.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#leaderboard">Leaderboard</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Update player's record in leaderboard.</td><td>The records will be stored in a separate table of a SQLite database alongside their usernames. If the player's time is shorter than their record, it should be replaced in the database.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#leaderboard">Leaderboard</a></li><li><a href="1.4b-computational-methods.md#thinking-ahead">Thinking Ahead</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Non-functional

<table><thead><tr><th width="107">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>20</td><td>Adhere to PEGI 7 rating.</td><td>My game should not include any content that is unsuitable for an audience of age 7 and above.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md#age-rating-for-my-game">Age rating for my game</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Refuse the player access to multiplayer and leaderboard functionality if they decide not to login.</td><td>Only registered users will be able to play multiplayer or have their score saved to the leaderboard, so if the player decides against logging in, the relevant buttons should not appear on the title screen.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#title-screen">Title screen</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>
