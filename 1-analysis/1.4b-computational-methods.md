# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction means the removal of unnecessary information in a problem to focus only on the important information. It is useful in programming because it helps avoid over-complicating the solution and allows the developer to focus on the high-level design of the program.

My game will use abstraction in the following ways:

* Graphics: While I would like to make detailed graphics, I will start with basic graphics so I can focus on programming. If I still have time after completing my game, I will improve the graphics.
* Enemy detection of player: When a player comes within a given radius of a monster, my game will imagine a triangle and use trigonometric functions to work out what X and Y speed to move at to get to the player. This algorithm is relatively easy to implement and makes the game more challenging.
* Player movement: The car will continually move at the speed property, which is increased or decreased by pressing W or S and the car can be turned left or right through A and D buttons. Friction on the road results in the car eventually becoming still again if the player stops interacting with it. I will use simple names to describe what each variable's purpose is and only include properties I see necessary to give driving the car a realistic feel.
* Map loading: The map including the race track and the environment on each side of the road will likely take up a lot of resources being rendered all at once and the game could become unplayable due to lag. Therefore, my game will continually destroy all blocks and re-render only the ones in the view of the game's camera.&#x20;

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is important in programming because it provides the developer or developers with a clear idea of what they want the final product to look like. I will think about what tasks I must carry out and in what order I will perform them for my final solution to look how I envision it.&#x20;

For example, I know my game will be written in Javascript, playable in the web browser, and that I will use Kaboom.js to simplify the development of the gameplay element. Additionally, my game will have four levels set in different environments and at the end a final leaderboard will be shown with each player and their position. Furthermore, I want to allow each player to have their own unique identity so I will require players sign up for an account in order to play. I have decided to store user account information using Node.js's SQLite library. SQLite is a free-to-use and self-contained version of the popular SQL database engine, which means my server store and access large amounts of data quickly. Finally, Node.js is a server-based JavaScript runtime which means I will need to find a suitable and cheap or free provider to host my game.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable problems. It is useful because it simplifies development of the solution and makes it easier to apply changes. I will focus on one section of my game at a time and finish a section before starting on another.&#x20;

My game will use decomposition and procedural thinking to bundle interactive elements of the game such as monster behaviour and activating power-ups into separate functions so that if any bugs arise, I can easily fix them without scrolling through long code looking for the specific part causing the bug. This also increases the maintainability of the code as future developers will get a basic idea of what each function does.

## Thinking Logically

My game should allow the player to make decisions when multiple options are presented to them. To do this, it must be prepared for any possible decisions the player might make when playing.

### Title screen

* The player may not be signed in. The game must check for this before loading any screen. If the player is not signed in, they will be shown a separate screen informing them they must do so to play the game, along with a button that takes them to the sign in page.

### Login/Sign Up screen

* The player may enter invalid credentials when logging in, so the login should be prepared for this happening and be able to inform the player through a means in which they understand.
* The player may choose a username that has already been taken when signing up, so the registration should be prepared for this possibility and inform the player.&#x20;
* The player may attempt to enter in a password which is too few characters. If this happens, the registration should refuse to proceed until the player has corrected this.

### Gameplay

* My game will continually check for keyboard input from the player and carry out corresponding functionality, such as to move forward or turn left. It should be prepared the player will press keys that do not have any action and ignore them.
* Chests containing power-ups will be randomly scattered across the map. The player can only store one power-up at a time. The game must be prepared for the player to collide with a chest while already having a power-up waiting to be used. If this happens, it must keep the existing power-up in the box in the top left corner.
* The player may drive off the road and onto the environment section of the map. This could cause problems if they drive off the screen completely and cannot see their car as they will have a harder time getting back onto the screen. To solve this, the game should check if the player goes off either side of the screen and stop them going further.

### Multiplayer

* My game should be prepared for the possibility of a player disconnecting during the waiting stage or during gameplay itself. If this happens, the quitting player's name should be removed from the list of players if on the waiting screen or their car removed if in the gameplay stage.
* Online multiplayer games are often impacted by lag. Therefore, when a player moves, they should broadcast their new position and angle to all other players in the room, for whom the game will set that player's car to those properties so that each player's car position is always consistent for all players.

## Thinking Concurrently

My game will need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously by breaking them down into sub-tasks. Here are some examples:

* Enemies must continually check if the player is within a specific range of them even while other tasks are taking place, such as checking for keys or the player activating their selected weapon.&#x20;
* In multiplayer mode, the Node.js server must be able to handle all requests from different sessions at once. For example, two multiplayer sessions could be running at the same time, so the server should be able to distinguish between the two sessions in its responses to prevent confusion.
