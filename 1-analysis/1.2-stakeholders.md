## Demographics

The above study shows that 18-34 year olds make up the vast majority of gamers in the US, with 36% of gamers being in this age range. This is followed by under 18 year olds at 24%. With the exception of 18-34 year olds, the older one gets the less likely they are to play video games, with only 6% of gamers being 65 years or older.

A survey of gamers in the United States in 2022 shows that the main reason people play video games is to spend/pass free time, with over 80% of respondents agreeing. While playing with friends is one of the least popular reasons, almost 50% of respondents still gave it as a reason. To make my game appeal to a wide range of gamers, I should make it consume a lot of time, increase the challenge faced by the player as they progress, and incorporate a multiplayer feature.

## PEGI ratings system

### What is PEGI and how is it determined?

The purpose of PEGI (Pan European Game Information) ratings are to provide guidance to parents to help them decide whether to buy a game for their child. It is used and recognised throughout Europe and considered a model in protecting children from violent and inappropriate content [(PEGI Age Ratings, 2017)](https://pegi.info/page/pegi-age-ratings).

PEGI uses a set of criteria to determine the age rating for a game, but it has two different procedures: pre-release verification and post-release verification  Pre-release was more common when games were distributed as a physical copy, such as a disc, while post-release was created to deal with thousands of apps being published to online app stores daily and a lack of time to rate them all manually [(PEGI Public Site, 2020)](https://pegi.info/page/how-we-rate-games). I will be choosing post-release verification as I will be distributing my game via the internet and not as a physical disc.

### What do the different ratings mean?

**PEGI 3:** Content suitable for all age groups. Should not contain any media likely to frighten young children, and only a mild form of violence is acceptable.&#x20;

**PEGI 7:** Content can possibly be frightening to young children. Implied, non-detailed, and non-realistic violence are acceptable.

**PEGI 12:** Violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or unrealistic violence towards human characters. Mild bad language and sexual innuendo acceptable.

**PEGI 16:** Violence looks the same as would be expected in real life. More extreme bad language, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs can be present.

**PEGI 18:** Depiction of gross violence, motiveless killing, and violence towards defenceless characters. Use of illegal drugs, simulation of gambling, and explicit sexual activity.

### Age rating for my game

The average age of a gamer in Europe as of 2021 was 31.3 years old [(Interactive Software Federation of Europe, 2021)](https://www.isfe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/FINAL-ISFE-EGDFKey-Facts-from-2021-about-Europe-video-games-sector-web.pdf). I want my game to attract both children and adults and therefore I have decided to rate it a PEGI 7. While my game will have some violence, it will not contain anything particularly gory, and therefore I have decided to give the game a rating of a PEGI 7. This will make it attractive to all age groups as demonstrated by the success of Minecraft, which shares the rating and remains one of the most played games among both children and adults, with an average player age of 24 years [(Capel, 2019)](https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/player-age).
