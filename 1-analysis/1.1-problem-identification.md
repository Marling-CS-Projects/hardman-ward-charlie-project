# 1.1 Problem Identification

## What is loneliness and why is it a problem?

Loneliness is defined as "a subjective, unwelcome feeling of lack or loss of companionship, which happens when there is a mismatch between the quantity and quality of the social relationships that we have, and those that we want" [(Campaign to End Loneliness, 2023)](https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/facts-and-statistics/).

Over the past three years, loneliness has spiked, especially among young adults, in part due to restrictions implemented by governments to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic [(Pidd, 2020)](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/08/study-finds-half-of-16--to-24-year-olds-hit-by-lockdown-loneliness). However, the pandemic is not solely to blame for a rise in loneliness among young adults, with a pre-pandemic survey revealing 40% of 16-24 year olds in the UK felt lonely often, in contrast to 29% of 65-74 year olds and 27% of 75+ year olds [(University of Manchester, 2018)](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/loneliest-age-group/). Research has shown social isolation significantly increases the risk of premature death from all causes, and has been compared to smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity [(Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021)](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/lonely-older-adults.html).

## How can video games help?

Video games is an ever-growing industry, with revenue projected to reach $327bn internationally in 2023. It is forecasted to grow 7.8% per year between 2023 and 2027 [(Statista, 2022)](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/video-games/worldwide). The number of gamers has been rising steadfastly in the past six years, going from 2.39 billion in 2017 to 3.26 billion in 2023. It is currently projected to reach 3.8 billion by 2027 [(Clement, 2022)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/748044/number-video-gamers-world/).

Gamers are stereotypically unattractive, unpopular, idle, and socially incompetent [(Grohol, 2013)](https://psychcentral.com/blog/gamer-stereotypes-just-arent-true). However, a 2013 study showed more than 70% of gamers play online with friends. Additionally, online multiplayer games such as World of Warcraft have become virtual social communities [(Granic, 2013)](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/11/video-games).

Various studies have linked gaming to improvement of social skills. Multiplayer games facilitate social interaction and combat isolation by connecting players with strangers and friends alike [(Nebel and Ninaus, 2022)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8873111/). Additionally, video games provide a temporary diversion from real-world adverse events or emotions, and have an overall positive effect on the psychological well-being of individuals [(Pallavicini, Pepe and Mantovani, 2022)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360974058\_The\_Effects\_of\_Playing\_Video\_Games\_on\_Stress\_Anxiety\_Depression\_Loneliness\_and\_Gaming\_Disorder\_During\_the\_Early\_Stages\_of\_the\_COVID-19\_Pandemic\_PRISMA\_Systematic\_Review).
